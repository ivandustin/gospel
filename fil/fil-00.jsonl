He was with God in the beginning. Everything was made through Him, and nothing was made without Him. In Him was life, and that life was the light of all people. The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness has not overcome it.\n\nThere was a man sent from God whose name was John. He came as a witness to testify about the light, so that through him all might believe. He himself was not the light; he came only as a witness to the light. The true light that gives light to everyone was coming into the world.\n\nHe was in the world, and though the world was made through Him, the world did not recognize Him. He came to His own, but His own did not receive Him. Yet to all who did receive Him, to those who believed in His name, He gave the right to become children of God--children born not of natural descent, nor of human decision or a husband's will, but born of God.\n\nThe Word became flesh and made His dwelling among us. We have seen His glory, the glory of the one and only Son, who came from the Father, full of grace and truth.\n\nJohn testified about Him. He cried out, saying, \"This is the one I spoke about when I said, 'He who comes after me has surpassed me because He was before me.'\" From His fullness, we have all received grace upon grace. For the law was given through Moses; grace and truth came through Jesus Christ.\n\nNo one has ever seen God, but the one and only Son, who is Himself God and is in closest relationship with the Father, has made Him known.\n\nThis was John's testimony when the Jewish leaders in Jerusalem sent priests and Levites to ask him who he was. He did not fail to confess, but confessed freely, \"I am not the Messiah.\" They asked him, \"Then who are you? Are you Elijah?\" He said, \"I am not.\" \"Are you the Prophet?\" He answered, \"No.\"\n\nFinally, they said, \"Who are you? Give us an answer to take back to those who sent us. What do you say about yourself?\" John replied in the words of Isaiah the prophet, \"I am the voice of one calling in the wilderness, 'Make straight the way for the Lord.'\"\n\nNow the Pharisees who had been sent questioned him, \"Why then do you baptize if you are not the Messiah, nor Elijah, nor the Prophet?\"\n\n\"I baptize with water,\" John replied, \"but among you stands one you do not know. He is the one who comes after me, the straps of whose sandals I am not worthy to untie.\"\n\nThis all happened at Bethany on the other side of the Jordan, where John was baptizing.\n\nThe next day John saw Jesus coming toward him and said, \"Look, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world! This is the one I meant when I said, 'A man who comes after me has surpassed me because He was before me.' I myself did not know Him, but the reason I came baptizing with water was that He might be revealed to Israel.\"\n\nThen John gave this testimony: \"I saw the Spirit come down from heaven as a dove and remain on Him. And I myself did not know Him, but the one who sent me to baptize with water told me, 'The man on whom you see the Spirit come down and remain is the one who will baptize with the Holy Spirit.' I have seen and I testify that this is God's Chosen One.\"\n\nThe next day John was there again with two of his disciples. When he saw Jesus passing by, he said, \"Look, the Lamb of God!\" When the two disciples heard him say this, they followed Jesus.\n\nTurning around, Jesus saw them following and asked, \"What do you want?\"\n\nThey said, \"Rabbi\" (which means \"Teacher\"), \"where are you staying?\"\n\n\"Come,\" He replied, \"and you will see.\" So they went and saw where He was staying, and they spent that day with Him. It was about four in the afternoon.\n\nAndrew, Simon Peter's brother, was one of the two who heard what John had said and who had followed Jesus. The first thing Andrew did was to find his brother Simon and tell him, \"We have found the Messiah\" (that is, the Christ). And he brought him to Jesus.\n\nJesus looked at him and said, \"You are Simon son of John. You will be called Cephas\" (which, when translated, is Peter).\n\nThe next day Jesus decided to leave for Galilee. Finding Philip, He said to him, \"Follow me.\" Philip, like Andrew and Peter, was from the town of Bethsaida.\n\nPhilip found Nathanael and told him, \"We have found the one Moses wrote about in the Law, and about whom the prophets also wrote--Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph.\"\n\n\"Nazareth! Can anything good come from there?\" Nathanael asked.\n\n\"Come and see,\" said Philip.\n\nWhen Jesus saw Nathanael approaching, He said of him, \"Here truly is an Israelite in whom there is no deceit.\"\n\n\"How do you know me?\" Nathanael asked.\n\nJesus answered, \"I saw you while you were still under the fig tree before Philip called you.\"\n\nThen Nathanael declared, \"Rabbi, you are the Son of God; you are the king of Israel.\"\n\nJesus said, \"You believe because I told you I saw you under the fig tree. You will see greater things than that.\" He then added, \"Very truly I tell you, you will see heaven open, and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of Man.\""}], "temperature": 0, "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"name": "schema", "schema": {"properties": {"translation": {"type": "string"}}, "required": ["translation"], "type": "object"}}}}}

Jesus and his disciples were also invited to the wedding. When the wine ran out, Jesus' mother told him, \"They have no wine.\" Jesus replied, \"Why are you involving me, woman? My time has not yet come.\" His mother told the servants, \"Do whatever he tells you.\"\n\nThere were six stone water jars there, used for the Jewish purification rituals, each holding twenty to thirty gallons. Jesus told the servants, \"Fill the jars with water,\" and they filled them to the brim. Then he said, \"Now draw some out and take it to the master of the banquet.\" They did so, and the master of the banquet tasted the water that had been turned into wine. He did not know where it had come from, though the servants who had drawn the water knew. He called the bridegroom aside and said, \"Everyone brings out the choice wine first and then the cheaper wine after the guests have had too much to drink; but you have saved the best till now.\"\n\nThis was the first of the signs Jesus performed in Cana of Galilee, and it revealed his glory, and his disciples believed in him. After this, he went down to Capernaum with his mother, brothers, and disciples, and they stayed there for a few days.\n\nWhen it was almost time for the Jewish Passover, Jesus went up to Jerusalem. In the temple courts, he found people selling cattle, sheep, and doves, and others sitting at tables exchanging money. So he made a whip out of cords and drove all from the temple courts, both sheep and cattle; he scattered the coins of the money changers and overturned their tables. To those who sold doves, he said, \"Get these out of here! Stop turning my Father's house into a market!\" His disciples remembered that it is written: \"Zeal for your house will consume me.\"\n\nThe Jews then responded to him, \"What sign can you show us to prove your authority to do all this?\" Jesus answered them, \"Destroy this temple, and I will raise it again in three days.\" They replied, \"It has taken forty-six years to build this temple, and you are going to raise it in three days?\" But the temple he had spoken of was his body. After he was raised from the dead, his disciples recalled what he had said. Then they believed the scripture and the words that Jesus had spoken.\n\nWhile he was in Jerusalem at the Passover Festival, many people saw the signs he was performing and believed in his name. But Jesus would not entrust himself to them, for he knew all people. He did not need any testimony about mankind, for he knew what was in each person."}], "temperature": 0, "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"name": "schema", "schema": {"properties": {"translation": {"type": "string"}}, "required": ["translation"], "type": "object"}}}}}

He came to Jesus at night and said, \"Teacher, we know you have come from God because no one can do the miracles you do unless God is with him.\" Jesus replied, \"Truly, I tell you, unless someone is born again, they cannot see the kingdom of God.\" Nicodemus asked, \"How can someone be born when they are old? Can they enter their mother's womb a second time?\" Jesus answered, \"Truly, I tell you, unless someone is born of water and the Spirit, they cannot enter the kingdom of God. What is born of the flesh is flesh, and what is born of the Spirit is spirit. Don't be surprised that I said you must be born again. The wind blows where it wants, and you hear its sound, but you don't know where it comes from or where it goes. So it is with everyone born of the Spirit.\" Nicodemus asked, \"How can this be?\" Jesus replied, \"You are a teacher of Israel, and you don't understand these things? Truly, I tell you, we speak of what we know and testify to what we have seen, but you do not accept our testimony. If I have told you earthly things and you do not believe, how will you believe if I tell you heavenly things? No one has ascended to heaven except the one who came down from heaven, the Son of Man. Just as Moses lifted up the snake in the wilderness, so must the Son of Man be lifted up, so that everyone who believes in him may have eternal life. For God loved the world so much that he gave his only Son, so that everyone who believes in him will not perish but have eternal life. God did not send his Son into the world to condemn it, but to save it through him. Whoever believes in him is not condemned, but whoever does not believe is already condemned because they have not believed in the name of God's only Son. This is the judgment: the light has come into the world, but people loved darkness instead of light because their deeds were evil. Everyone who does evil hates the light and does not come to the light for fear that their deeds will be exposed. But whoever lives by the truth comes to the light, so that it may be seen that their deeds have been done in God. After this, Jesus and his disciples went to the Judean countryside, where he spent some time with them and baptized. John was also baptizing at Aenon near Salim because there was plenty of water, and people were coming and being baptized. John had not yet been put in prison. An argument developed between some of John's disciples and a certain Jew over ceremonial washing. They came to John and said, \"Rabbi, the man who was with you on the other side of the Jordan, the one you testified about, is baptizing, and everyone is going to him.\" John replied, \"A person can receive only what is given them from heaven. You yourselves can testify that I said, 'I am not the Messiah but am sent ahead of him.' The bride belongs to the bridegroom. The friend who attends the bridegroom waits and listens for him and is full of joy when he hears the bridegroom's voice. That joy is mine, and it is now complete. He must become greater; I must become less. The one who comes from above is above all; the one who is from the earth belongs to the earth and speaks as one from the earth. The one who comes from heaven is above all. He testifies to what he has seen and heard, but no one accepts his testimony. Whoever has accepted it has certified that God is truthful. For the one whom God has sent speaks the words of God, for God gives the Spirit without limit. The Father loves the Son and has placed everything in his hands. Whoever believes in the Son has eternal life, but whoever rejects the Son will not see life, for God's wrath remains on them.\""}], "temperature": 0, "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"name": "schema", "schema": {"properties": {"translation": {"type": "string"}}, "required": ["translation"], "type": "object"}}}}}

He had to go through Samaria, and he came to a town called Sychar, near the land Jacob gave to his son Joseph. Jacob's well was there, and Jesus, tired from his journey, sat by the well. It was about noon.\n\nA Samaritan woman came to draw water, and Jesus asked her, \"Give me a drink.\" His disciples had gone into town to buy food. The woman said, \"How can you, a Jew, ask me, a Samaritan woman, for a drink?\" Jews didn't associate with Samaritans.\n\nJesus answered, \"If you knew the gift of God and who is asking you for a drink, you would have asked him, and he would have given you living water.\" The woman said, \"Sir, you have nothing to draw with, and the well is deep. Where can you get this living water? Are you greater than our father Jacob, who gave us the well and drank from it himself, as did his sons and livestock?\"\n\nJesus said, \"Everyone who drinks this water will be thirsty again, but whoever drinks the water I give them will never thirst. Indeed, the water I give will become a spring of water welling up to eternal life.\" The woman said, \"Sir, give me this water so I won't get thirsty and have to keep coming here to draw water.\"\n\nHe told her, \"Go, call your husband and come back.\" \"I have no husband,\" she replied. Jesus said, \"You are right when you say you have no husband. The fact is, you have had five husbands, and the man you now have is not your husband. What you have just said is quite true.\"\n\n\"Sir,\" the woman said, \"I can see that you are a prophet. Our ancestors worshiped on this mountain, but you Jews claim that the place where we must worship is in Jerusalem.\"\n\nJesus replied, \"Believe me, a time is coming when you will worship the Father neither on this mountain nor in Jerusalem. You Samaritans worship what you do not know; we worship what we do know, for salvation is from the Jews. Yet a time is coming and has now come when the true worshipers will worship the Father in the Spirit and in truth, for they are the kind of worshipers the Father seeks. God is spirit, and his worshipers must worship in the Spirit and in truth.\"\n\nThe woman said, \"I know that Messiah\" (called Christ) \"is coming. When he comes, he will explain everything to us.\" Then Jesus declared, \"I, the one speaking to you--I am he.\"\n\nJust then his disciples returned and were surprised to find him talking with a woman. But no one asked, \"What do you want?\" or \"Why are you talking with her?\"\n\nThen, leaving her water jar, the woman went back to the town and said to the people, \"Come, see a man who told me everything I ever did. Could this be the Messiah?\" They came out of the town and made their way toward him.\n\nMeanwhile, his disciples urged him, \"Rabbi, eat something.\" But he said to them, \"I have food to eat that you know nothing about.\" Then his disciples said to each other, \"Could someone have brought him food?\"\n\n\"My food,\" said Jesus, \"is to do the will of him who sent me and to finish his work. Don't you have a saying, 'It's still four months until harvest'? I tell you, open your eyes and look at the fields! They are ripe for harvest. Even now the one who reaps draws a wage and harvests a crop for eternal life, so that the sower and the reaper may be glad together. Thus the saying 'One sows and another reaps' is true. I sent you to reap what you have not worked for. Others have done the hard work, and you have reaped the benefits of their labor.\"\n\nMany of the Samaritans from that town believed in him because of the woman's testimony, \"He told me everything I ever did.\" So when the Samaritans came to him, they urged him to stay with them, and he stayed two days. And because of his words, many more became believers.\n\nThey said to the woman, \"We no longer believe just because of what you said; now we have heard for ourselves, and we know that this man really is the Savior of the world.\"\n\nAfter the two days, he left for Galilee. (Now Jesus himself had pointed out that a prophet has no honor in his own country.) When he arrived in Galilee, the Galileans welcomed him. They had seen all that he had done in Jerusalem at the Passover Festival, for they also had been there.\n\nOnce more he visited Cana in Galilee, where he had turned the water into wine. And there was a certain royal official whose son lay sick at Capernaum. When this man heard that Jesus had arrived in Galilee from Judea, he went to him and begged him to come and heal his son, who was close to death.\n\n\"Unless you people see signs and wonders,\" Jesus told him, \"you will never believe.\"\n\nThe royal official said, \"Sir, come down before my child dies.\"\n\n\"Go,\" Jesus replied, \"your son will live.\"\n\nThe man took Jesus at his word and departed. While he was still on the way, his servants met him with the news that his boy was living. When he inquired as to the time when his son got better, they said to him, \"Yesterday, at one in the afternoon, the fever left him.\"\n\nThen the father realized that this was the exact time at which Jesus had said to him, \"Your son will live.\" So he and his whole household believed.\n\nThis was the second sign Jesus performed after coming from Judea to Galilee."}], "temperature": 0, "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"name": "schema", "schema": {"properties": {"translation": {"type": "string"}}, "required": ["translation"], "type": "object"}}}}}

In Jerusalem, there was a pool called Bethesda in Hebrew, which had five porches. Many sick people, blind, lame, and paralyzed, were lying there. There was a man who had been sick for thirty-eight years. Jesus saw him lying there and knew he had been sick for a long time, so he asked him, \"Do you want to get well?\" The sick man replied, \"Sir, I have no one to help me into the pool when the water is stirred. While I'm trying to get in, someone else goes down ahead of me.\" Jesus said to him, \"Get up, pick up your mat, and walk.\" Immediately, the man was healed, picked up his mat, and walked. This happened on a Sabbath day.\n\nThe Jewish leaders said to the man who had been healed, \"It's the Sabbath; you shouldn't be carrying your mat.\" But he replied, \"The man who healed me told me to pick up my mat and walk.\" They asked him, \"Who is this man who told you to pick it up and walk?\" But the man who was healed didn't know who it was, because Jesus had slipped away into the crowd.\n\nLater, Jesus found him in the temple and said, \"See, you are well again. Stop sinning or something worse may happen to you.\" The man went away and told the Jewish leaders that it was Jesus who had made him well. Because of this, the Jewish leaders began to persecute Jesus, because he was doing these things on the Sabbath. But Jesus said to them, \"My Father is always at work, and I too am working.\" This made the Jewish leaders even more determined to kill him, because not only was he breaking the Sabbath, but he was also calling God his own Father, making himself equal with God.\n\nJesus gave them this answer: \"Truly, I tell you, the Son can do nothing by himself; he can only do what he sees his Father doing, because whatever the Father does, the Son also does. For the Father loves the Son and shows him all he does. Yes, and he will show him even greater works than these, so that you will be amazed. For just as the Father raises the dead and gives them life, even so the Son gives life to whom he is pleased to give it. Moreover, the Father judges no one, but has entrusted all judgment to the Son, that all may honor the Son just as they honor the Father. Whoever does not honor the Son does not honor the Father who sent him.\n\n\"Truly, I tell you, whoever hears my word and believes him who sent me has eternal life and will not be judged but has crossed over from death to life. Truly, I tell you, a time is coming and has now come when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God and those who hear will live. For as the Father has life in himself, so he has granted the Son also to have life in himself. And he has given him authority to judge because he is the Son of Man.\n\n\"Do not be amazed at this, for a time is coming when all who are in their graves will hear his voice and come out--those who have done good will rise to live, and those who have done evil will rise to be condemned. By myself, I can do nothing; I judge only as I hear, and my judgment is just, for I seek not to please myself but him who sent me.\n\n\"If I testify about myself, my testimony is not true. There is another who testifies in my favor, and I know that his testimony about me is true. You have sent to John and he has testified to the truth. Not that I accept human testimony, but I mention it that you may be saved. John was a lamp that burned and gave light, and you chose for a time to enjoy his light.\n\n\"I have testimony weightier than that of John. For the works that the Father has given me to finish--the very works that I am doing--testify that the Father has sent me. And the Father who sent me has himself testified concerning me. You have never heard his voice nor seen his form, nor does his word dwell in you, for you do not believe the one he sent.\n\n\"You study the Scriptures diligently because you think that in them you have eternal life. These are the very Scriptures that testify about me, yet you refuse to come to me to have life. I do not accept glory from human beings, but I know you. I know that you do not have the love of God in your hearts. I have come in my Father's name, and you do not accept me; but if someone else comes in his own name, you will accept him.\n\n\"How can you believe since you accept glory from one another but do not seek the glory that comes from the only God? But do not think I will accuse you before the Father. Your accuser is Moses, on whom your hopes are set. If you believed Moses, you would believe me, for he wrote about me.

A large crowd followed him because they saw the miracles he performed on the sick. Jesus went up a mountain and sat there with his disciples. It was almost time for the Jewish Passover festival. When Jesus looked up and saw a large crowd coming toward him, he asked Philip, \"Where can we buy bread for these people to eat?\" He asked this to test Philip, because he already knew what he was going to do. Philip answered, \"Even if we had two hundred silver coins, it wouldn't be enough to buy bread for everyone to have a little.\" Another disciple, Andrew, Simon Peter's brother, said, \"Here is a boy with five small barley loaves and two small fish, but how far will they go among so many?\" Jesus said, \"Have the people sit down.\" There was plenty of grass there, and they sat down. About five thousand men were there. Jesus took the loaves, gave thanks, and distributed them to those who were seated, as much as they wanted. He did the same with the fish. When they had all had enough to eat, he said to his disciples, \"Gather the pieces that are left over. Let nothing be wasted.\" So they gathered them and filled twelve baskets with the pieces of the five barley loaves left over by those who had eaten. After the people saw the sign Jesus performed, they began to say, \"Surely this is the Prophet who is to come into the world.\" Jesus, knowing that they intended to come and make him king by force, withdrew again to a mountain by himself. When evening came, his disciples went down to the lake, where they got into a boat and set off across the lake for Capernaum. By now it was dark, and Jesus had not yet joined them. A strong wind was blowing, and the waters grew rough. When they had rowed about three or four miles, they saw Jesus approaching the boat, walking on the water, and they were frightened. But he said to them, \"It is I; don't be afraid.\" Then they were willing to take him into the boat, and immediately the boat reached the shore where they were heading. The next day the crowd that had stayed on the opposite shore of the lake realized that only one boat had been there, and that Jesus had not entered it with his disciples, but that they had gone away alone. Then some boats from Tiberias landed near the place where the people had eaten the bread after the Lord had given thanks. Once the crowd realized that neither Jesus nor his disciples were there, they got into the boats and went to Capernaum in search of Jesus. When they found him on the other side of the lake, they asked him, \"Rabbi, when did you get here?\" Jesus answered, \"Very truly I tell you, you are looking for me, not because you saw the signs I performed but because you ate the loaves and had your fill. Do not work for food that spoils, but for food that endures to eternal life, which the Son of Man will give you. For on him God the Father has placed his seal of approval.\" Then they asked him, \"What must we do to do the works God requires?\" Jesus answered, \"The work of God is this: to believe in the one he has sent.\" So they asked him, \"What sign then will you give that we may see it and believe you? What will you do? Our ancestors ate the manna in the wilderness; as it is written: 'He gave them bread from heaven to eat.'\" Jesus said to them, \"Very truly I tell you, it is not Moses who has given you the bread from heaven, but it is my Father who gives you the true bread from heaven. For the bread of God is the bread that comes down from heaven and gives life to the world.\" \"Sir,\" they said, \"always give us this bread.\" Then Jesus declared, \"I am the bread of life. Whoever comes to me will never go hungry, and whoever believes in me will never be thirsty. But as I told you, you have seen me and still you do not believe. All those the Father gives me will come to me, and whoever comes to me I will never drive away. For I have come down from heaven not to do my will but to do the will of him who sent me. And this is the will of him who sent me, that I shall lose none of all those he has given me, but raise them up at the last day. For my Father's will is that everyone who looks to the Son and believes in him shall have eternal life, and I will raise them up at the last day.\" At this the Jews there began to grumble about him because he said, \"I am the bread that came down from heaven.\" They said, \"Is this not Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? How can he now say, 'I came down from heaven'?\" \"Stop grumbling among yourselves,\" Jesus answered. \"No one can come to me unless the Father who sent me draws them, and I will raise them up at the last day. It is written in the Prophets: 'They will all be taught by God.' Everyone who has heard the Father and learned from him comes to me. No one has seen the Father except the one who is from God; only he has seen the Father. Very truly I tell you, the one who believes has eternal life. I am the bread of life. Your ancestors ate the manna in the wilderness, yet they died. But here is the bread that comes down from heaven, which anyone may eat and not die. I am the living bread that came down from heaven. Whoever eats this bread will live forever. This bread is my flesh, which I will give for the life of the world.\" Then the Jews began to argue sharply among themselves, \"How can this man give us his flesh to eat?\" Jesus said to them, \"Very truly I tell you, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood, you have no life in you. Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life, and I will raise them up at the last day. For my flesh is real food and my blood is real drink. Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood remains in me, and I in them. Just as the living Father sent me and I live because of the Father, so the one who feeds on me will live because of me. This is the bread that came down from heaven. Your ancestors ate manna and died, but whoever feeds on this bread will live forever.\" He said this while teaching in the synagogue in Capernaum. On hearing it, many of his disciples said, \"This is a hard teaching. Who can accept it?\" Aware that his disciples were grumbling about this, Jesus said to them, \"Does this offend you? Then what if you see the Son of Man ascend to where he was before! The Spirit gives life; the flesh counts for nothing. The words I have spoken to you--they are full of the Spirit and life. Yet there are some of you who do not believe.\" For Jesus had known from the beginning which of them did not believe and who would betray him. He went on to say, \"This is why I told you that no one can come to me unless the Father has enabled them.\" From this time many of his disciples turned back and no longer followed him. \"You do not want to leave too, do you?\" Jesus asked the Twelve. Simon Peter answered him, \"Lord, to whom shall we go? You have the words of eternal life. We have come to believe and to know that you are the Holy One of God.\" Then Jesus replied, \"Have I not chosen you, the Twelve? Yet one of you is a devil!\" (He meant Judas, the son of Simon Iscariot, who, though one of the Twelve, was later to betray him.)"}], "temperature": 0, "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"name": "schema", "schema": {"properties": {"translation": {"type": "string"}}, "required": ["translation"], "type": "object"}}}}}

You go to the festival; I'm not going yet because my time hasn't fully come.\" After saying this, he stayed in Galilee. But after his brothers went to the festival, he also went, not openly, but secretly. The Jewish leaders were looking for him at the festival and asking, \"Where is he?\" There was a lot of whispering about him among the crowds. Some said, \"He's a good man,\" while others said, \"No, he deceives the people.\" But no one spoke openly about him because they were afraid of the Jewish leaders. \n\nHalfway through the festival, Jesus went to the temple and began to teach. The Jewish leaders were amazed and asked, \"How did this man get such learning without having been taught?\" Jesus answered, \"My teaching is not my own. It comes from the one who sent me. If anyone chooses to do God's will, they will find out whether my teaching comes from God or whether I speak on my own. Whoever speaks on their own does so to gain personal glory, but he who seeks the glory of the one who sent him is a man of truth; there is nothing false about him. Hasn't Moses given you the law? Yet not one of you keeps the law. Why are you trying to kill me?\" The crowd answered, \"You are demon-possessed. Who is trying to kill you?\" Jesus said, \"I did one miracle, and you are all amazed. Yet, because Moses gave you circumcision (though actually it did not come from Moses, but from the patriarchs), you circumcise a boy on the Sabbath. Now if a boy can be circumcised on the Sabbath so that the law of Moses may not be broken, why are you angry with me for healing a man's whole body on the Sabbath? Stop judging by mere appearances, but instead judge correctly.\"\n\nSome of the people of Jerusalem began to ask, \"Isn't this the man they are trying to kill? Here he is, speaking publicly, and they are not saying a word to him. Have the authorities really concluded that he is the Messiah? But we know where this man is from; when the Messiah comes, no one will know where he is from.\" Then Jesus, still teaching in the temple courts, cried out, \"Yes, you know me, and you know where I am from. I am not here on my own authority, but he who sent me is true. You do not know him, but I know him because I am from him and he sent me.\" At this, they tried to seize him, but no one laid a hand on him because his hour had not yet come. Still, many in the crowd believed in him. They said, \"When the Messiah comes, will he perform more signs than this man?\"\n\nThe Pharisees heard the crowd whispering such things about him. Then the chief priests and the Pharisees sent temple guards to arrest him. Jesus said, \"I am with you for only a short time, and then I am going to the one who sent me. You will look for me, but you will not find me; and where I am, you cannot come.\" The Jews said to one another, \"Where does this man intend to go that we cannot find him? Will he go where our people live scattered among the Greeks, and teach the Greeks? What did he mean when he said, 'You will look for me, but you will not find me,' and 'Where I am, you cannot come'?\"\n\nOn the last and greatest day of the festival, Jesus stood and said in a loud voice, \"Let anyone who is thirsty come to me and drink. Whoever believes in me, as Scripture has said, rivers of living water will flow from within them.\" By this, he meant the Spirit, whom those who believed in him were later to receive. Up to that time, the Spirit had not been given, since Jesus had not yet been glorified. On hearing his words, some of the people said, \"Surely this man is the Prophet.\" Others said, \"He is the Messiah.\" Still others asked, \"How can the Messiah come from Galilee? Doesn't Scripture say that the Messiah will come from David's descendants and from Bethlehem, the town where David lived?\" Thus the people were divided because of Jesus. Some wanted to seize him, but no one laid a hand on him.\n\nFinally, the temple guards went back to the chief priests and the Pharisees, who asked them, \"Why didn't you bring him in?\" \"No one ever spoke the way this man does,\" the guards replied. \"You mean he has deceived you also?\" the Pharisees retorted. \"Have any of the rulers or of the Pharisees believed in him? No! But this mob that knows nothing of the law--there is a curse on them.\" Nicodemus, who had gone to Jesus earlier and who was one of their own number, asked, \"Does our law condemn a man without first hearing him to find out what he has been doing?\" They replied, \"Are you from Galilee, too? Look into it, and you will find that a prophet does not come out of Galilee.\" Then they all went home."}], "temperature": 0, "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"name": "schema", "schema": {"properties": {"translation": {"type": "string"}}, "required": ["translation"], "type": "object"}}}}}

Early in the morning, he returned to the temple, and all the people came to him, and he sat down and taught them. The scribes and Pharisees brought a woman caught in adultery and made her stand in the middle. They said to him, \"Teacher, this woman was caught in the act of adultery. In the law, Moses commanded us to stone such women. What do you say?\" They said this to test him, so they might have something to accuse him of. But Jesus bent down and wrote on the ground with his finger. When they kept questioning him, he straightened up and said to them, \"Let any one of you who is without sin be the first to throw a stone at her.\" Again he stooped down and wrote on the ground. Those who heard began to go away one at a time, the older ones first, until only Jesus was left, with the woman still standing there. Jesus straightened up and asked her, \"Woman, where are they? Has no one condemned you?\" \"No one, sir,\" she said. \"Then neither do I condemn you,\" Jesus declared. \"Go now and leave your life of sin.\"\n\nJesus spoke to the people again, saying, \"I am the light of the world. Whoever follows me will never walk in darkness, but will have the light of life.\" The Pharisees challenged him, \"Here you are, appearing as your own witness; your testimony is not valid.\" Jesus answered, \"Even if I testify on my own behalf, my testimony is valid, for I know where I came from and where I am going. But you have no idea where I come from or where I am going. You judge by human standards; I pass judgment on no one. But if I do judge, my decisions are true, because I am not alone. I stand with the Father, who sent me. In your own Law it is written that the testimony of two witnesses is true. I am one who testifies for myself; my other witness is the Father, who sent me.\" Then they asked him, \"Where is your father?\" \"You do not know me or my Father,\" Jesus replied. \"If you knew me, you would know my Father also.\"\n\nHe spoke these words while teaching in the temple courts near the place where the offerings were put. Yet no one seized him, because his hour had not yet come. Once more Jesus said to them, \"I am going away, and you will look for me, and you will die in your sin. Where I go, you cannot come.\" This made the Jews ask, \"Will he kill himself? Is that why he says, 'Where I go, you cannot come'?\" But he continued, \"You are from below; I am from above. You are of this world; I am not of this world. I told you that you would die in your sins; if you do not believe that I am he, you will indeed die in your sins.\"\n\n\"Who are you?\" they asked. \"Just what I have been telling you from the beginning,\" Jesus replied. \"I have much to say in judgment of you. But he who sent me is trustworthy, and what I have heard from him I tell the world.\" They did not understand that he was telling them about his Father. So Jesus said, \"When you have lifted up the Son of Man, then you will know that I am he and that I do nothing on my own but speak just what the Father has taught me. The one who sent me is with me; he has not left me alone, for I always do what pleases him.\" Even as he spoke, many believed in him.\n\nTo the Jews who had believed him, Jesus said, \"If you hold to my teaching, you are really my disciples. Then you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free.\" They answered him, \"We are Abraham's descendants and have never been slaves of anyone. How can you say that we shall be set free?\" Jesus replied, \"Very truly I tell you, everyone who sins is a slave to sin. Now a slave has no permanent place in the family, but a son belongs to it forever. So if the Son sets you free, you will be free indeed. I know that you are Abraham's descendants. Yet you are looking for a way to kill me, because you have no room for my word. I am telling you what I have seen in the Father's presence, and you are doing what you have heard from your father.\"\n\n\"Abraham is our father,\" they answered. \"If you were Abraham's children,\" said Jesus, \"then you would do what Abraham did. As it is, you are looking for a way to kill me, a man who has told you the truth that I heard from God. Abraham did not do such things. You are doing the works of your own father.\" \"We are not illegitimate children,\" they protested. \"The only Father we have is God himself.\" Jesus said to them, \"If God were your Father, you would love me, for I have come here from God. I have not come on my own; God sent me. Why is my language not clear to you? Because you are unable to hear what I say. You belong to your father, the devil, and you want to carry out your father's desires. He was a murderer from the beginning, not holding to the truth, for there is no truth in him. When he lies, he speaks his native language, for he is a liar and the father of lies. Yet because I tell the truth, you do not believe me! Can any of you prove me guilty of sin? If I am telling the truth, why don't you believe me? Whoever belongs to God hears what God says. The reason you do not hear is that you do not belong to God.\"\n\nThe Jews answered him, \"Aren't we right in saying that you are a Samaritan and demon-possessed?\" \"I am not possessed by a demon,\" said Jesus, \"but I honor my Father and you dishonor me. I am not seeking glory for myself; but there is one who seeks it, and he is the judge. Very truly I tell you, whoever obeys my word will never see death.\" At this they exclaimed, \"Now we know that you are demon-possessed! Abraham died and so did the prophets, yet you say that whoever obeys your word will never taste death. Are you greater than our father Abraham? He died, and so did the prophets. Who do you think you are?\" Jesus replied, \"If I glorify myself, my glory means nothing. My Father, whom you claim as your God, is the one who glorifies me. Though you do not know him, I know him. If I said I did not, I would be a liar like you, but I do know him and obey his word. Your father Abraham rejoiced at the thought of seeing my day; he saw it and was glad.\"\n\n\"You are not yet fifty years old,\" they said to him, \"and you have seen Abraham!\" \"Very truly I tell you,\" Jesus answered, \"before Abraham was born, I am!\" At this, they picked up stones to stone him, but Jesus hid himself, slipping away from the temple grounds."}], "temperature": 0, "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"name": "schema", "schema": {"properties": {"translation": {"type": "string"}}, "required": ["translation"], "type": "object"}}}}}

We must do the works of him who sent me while it is day. Night is coming, when no one can work. While I am in the world, I am the light of the world.\"\n\nAfter saying this, he spit on the ground, made some mud with the saliva, and put it on the man's eyes. \"Go,\" he told him, \"wash in the Pool of Siloam\" (this word means \"Sent\"). So the man went and washed, and came home seeing.\n\nHis neighbors and those who had seen him begging asked, \"Isn't this the same man who used to sit and beg?\" Some claimed that he was. Others said, \"No, he only looks like him.\" But he himself insisted, \"I am the man.\"\n\n\"How then were your eyes opened?\" they asked. He replied, \"The man they call Jesus made some mud and put it on my eyes. He told me to go to Siloam and wash. So I went and washed, and then I could see.\"\n\n\"Where is this man?\" they asked him. \"I don't know,\" he said.\n\nThey brought to the Pharisees the man who had been blind. Now the day on which Jesus had made the mud and opened the man's eyes was a Sabbath. Therefore the Pharisees also asked him how he had received his sight. \"He put mud on my eyes,\" the man replied, \"and I washed, and now I see.\"\n\nSome of the Pharisees said, \"This man is not from God, for he does not keep the Sabbath.\" But others asked, \"How can a sinner perform such signs?\" So they were divided.\n\nThen they turned again to the blind man, \"What have you to say about him? It was your eyes he opened.\" The man replied, \"He is a prophet.\"\n\nThey still did not believe that he had been blind and had received his sight until they sent for the man's parents. \"Is this your son?\" they asked. \"Is this the one you say was born blind? How is it that now he can see?\"\n\n\"We know he is our son,\" the parents answered, \"and we know he was born blind. But how he can see now, or who opened his eyes, we don't know. Ask him. He is of age; he will speak for himself.\"\n\nHis parents said this because they were afraid of the Jewish leaders, who already had decided that anyone who acknowledged that Jesus was the Messiah would be put out of the synagogue. That was why his parents said, \"He is of age; ask him.\"\n\nA second time they summoned the man who had been blind. \"Give glory to God by telling the truth,\" they said. \"We know this man is a sinner.\"\n\nHe replied, \"Whether he is a sinner or not, I don't know. One thing I do know. I was blind but now I see!\"\n\nThen they asked him, \"What did he do to you? How did he open your eyes?\"\n\nHe answered, \"I have told you already and you did not listen. Why do you want to hear it again? Do you want to become his disciples too?\"\n\nThen they hurled insults at him and said, \"You are this fellow's disciple! We are disciples of Moses! We know that God spoke to Moses, but as for this fellow, we don't even know where he comes from.\"\n\nThe man answered, \"Now that is remarkable! You don't know where he comes from, yet he opened my eyes. We know that God does not listen to sinners. He listens to the godly person who does his will. Nobody has ever heard of opening the eyes of a man born blind. If this man were not from God, he could do nothing.\"\n\nTo this they replied, \"You were steeped in sin at birth; how dare you lecture us!\" And they threw him out.\n\nJesus heard that they had thrown him out, and when he found him, he said, \"Do you believe in the Son of Man?\"\n\n\"Who is he, sir?\" the man asked. \"Tell me so that I may believe in him.\"\n\nJesus said, \"You have now seen him; in fact, he is the one speaking with you.\"\n\nThen the man said, \"Lord, I believe,\" and he worshiped him.\n\nJesus said, \"For judgment I have come into this world, so that the blind will see and those who see will become blind.\"\n\nSome Pharisees who were with him heard him say this and asked, \"What?

But the one who enters by the gate is the shepherd of the sheep. The gatekeeper opens the gate for him, and the sheep listen to his voice. He calls his own sheep by name and leads them out. When he has brought out all his own, he goes ahead of them, and the sheep follow him because they recognize his voice. They won't follow a stranger, but will run away, because they don't know the stranger's voice.\n\nJesus spoke this parable to them, but they didn't understand what he meant. So Jesus said again, \"Truly, truly, I tell you, I am the gate for the sheep. All who came before me are thieves and robbers, but the sheep didn't listen to them. I am the gate. If anyone enters through me, they will be saved and will come in and go out and find pasture. The thief only comes to steal, kill, and destroy. I have come so that they may have life and have it abundantly.\n\nI am the good shepherd. The good shepherd gives his life for the sheep. A hired hand, who is not the shepherd and doesn't own the sheep, sees the wolf coming, leaves the sheep, and runs away. The wolf snatches them and scatters the flock. The hired hand runs away because he is only hired and doesn't care about the sheep.\n\nI am the good shepherd. I know my sheep, and my sheep know me, just as the Father knows me, and I know the Father. I lay down my life for the sheep. I have other sheep that are not in this sheep pen. I must bring them also, and they will listen to my voice. There will be one flock and one shepherd. \n\nThis is why the Father loves me, because I lay down my life so that I may take it up again. No one takes it from me, but I lay it down of my own accord. I have the authority to lay it down and the authority to take it up again. I received this charge from my Father.\" \n\nThere was another division among the Jews because of these words. Many of them said, \"He has a demon and is mad. Why listen to him?\" Others said, \"These aren't the words of a demon-possessed person. Can a demon open the eyes of the blind?\"\n\nThen came the Feast of Dedication at Jerusalem in winter. Jesus was walking in the temple in Solomon's porch. The Jews surrounded him, asking, \"How long will you keep us in suspense? If you are the Christ, tell us plainly.\" Jesus replied, \"I told you, but you do not believe. The works I do in my Father's name testify of me. But you do not believe because you are not my sheep. My sheep hear my voice, I know them, and they follow me. I give them eternal life, and they shall never perish. No one will snatch them out of my hand. My Father, who has given them to me, is greater than all. No one can snatch them from my Father's hand. I and the Father are one.\"\n\nOnce again, the Jews picked up stones to stone him. Jesus answered them, \"I have shown you many good works from the Father. For which of these do you stone me?\" The Jews answered him, \"We're not stoning you for any good work but for blasphemy, because you, a mere man, claim to be God.\" Jesus said, \"Isn't it written in your law, 'I have said you are gods'? If he called them 'gods' to whom the word of God came--and Scripture cannot be set aside--what about the one whom the Father set apart as his very own and sent into the world? Why then do you accuse me of blasphemy because I said, 'I am God's Son'? \n\nIf I do not do the works of my Father, don't believe me. But if I do them, even if you don't believe me, believe the works themselves, so you may know and understand that the Father is in me, and I in the Father.\" Therefore, they wanted to seize him again, but he escaped from their grasp. He went back across the Jordan to the place where John had been baptizing at first, and he stayed there.

He was from Bethany, the village of Mary and her sister Martha. Mary was the one who had poured perfume on the Lord and wiped his feet with her hair. Lazarus, their brother, was sick. So the sisters sent a message to Jesus, saying, \"Lord, the one you love is sick.\" When Jesus heard this, he said, \"This sickness will not end in death. It is for God's glory so that God's Son may be glorified through it.\" Jesus loved Martha, her sister, and Lazarus. When he heard that Lazarus was sick, he stayed where he was for two more days. Then he said to his disciples, \"Let's go back to Judea.\" The disciples said, \"Rabbi, the Jews were just trying to stone you, and you're going back there?\" Jesus answered, \"Aren't there twelve hours of daylight? Anyone who walks in the daytime will not stumble, for they see by this world's light. It is when a person walks at night that they stumble, for they have no light.\" After he said this, he told them, \"Our friend Lazarus has fallen asleep, but I am going there to wake him up.\" His disciples replied, \"Lord, if he sleeps, he will get better.\" Jesus had been speaking of his death, but his disciples thought he meant natural sleep. So then he told them plainly, \"Lazarus is dead, and for your sake, I am glad I was not there, so that you may believe. But let us go to him.\" Then Thomas, also known as Didymus, said to the rest of the disciples, \"Let us also go, that we may die with him.\" When Jesus arrived, he found that Lazarus had already been in the tomb for four days. Bethany was less than two miles from Jerusalem, and many Jews had come to Martha and Mary to comfort them in the loss of their brother. When Martha heard that Jesus was coming, she went out to meet him, but Mary stayed at home. \"Lord,\" Martha said to Jesus, \"if you had been here, my brother would not have died. But I know that even now God will give you whatever you ask.\" Jesus said to her, \"Your brother will rise again.\" Martha answered, \"I know he will rise again in the resurrection at the last day.\" Jesus said to her, \"I am the resurrection and the life. The one who believes in me will live, even though they die; and whoever lives by believing in me will never die. Do you believe this?\" \"Yes, Lord,\" she replied, \"I believe that you are the Messiah, the Son of God, who is to come into the world.\" After she had said this, she went back and called her sister Mary aside. \"The Teacher is here,\" she said, \"and is asking for you.\" When Mary heard this, she got up quickly and went to him. Now Jesus had not yet entered the village, but was still at the place where Martha had met him. When the Jews who had been with Mary in the house, comforting her, noticed how quickly she got up and went out, they followed her, supposing she was going to the tomb to mourn there. When Mary reached the place where Jesus was and saw him, she fell at his feet and said, \"Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not have died.\" When Jesus saw her weeping, and the Jews who had come along with her also weeping, he was deeply moved in spirit and troubled. \"Where have you laid him?\" he asked. \"Come and see, Lord,\" they replied. Jesus wept. Then the Jews said, \"See how he loved him!\" But some of them said, \"Could not he who opened the eyes of the blind man have kept this man from dying?\" Jesus, once more deeply moved, came to the tomb. It was a cave with a stone laid across the entrance. \"Take away the stone,\" he said. \"But, Lord,\" said Martha, the sister of the dead man, \"by this time there is a bad odor, for he has been there four days.\" Then Jesus said, \"Did I not tell you that if you believe, you will see the glory of God?\" So they took away the stone. Then Jesus looked up and said, \"Father, I thank you that you have heard me. I knew that you always hear me, but I said this for the benefit of the people standing here, that they may believe that you sent me.\" When he had said this, Jesus called in a loud voice, \"Lazarus, come out!\" The dead man came out, his hands and feet wrapped with strips of linen, and a cloth around his face. Jesus said to them, \"Take off the grave clothes and let him go.\" Therefore many of the Jews who had come to visit Mary, and had seen what Jesus did, believed in him. But some of them went to the Pharisees and told them what Jesus had done. Then the chief priests and the Pharisees called a meeting of the Sanhedrin. \"What are we accomplishing?\" they asked. \"Here is this man performing many signs. If we let him go on like this, everyone will believe in him, and then the Romans will come and take away both our temple and our nation.\" Then one of them, named Caiaphas, who was high priest that year, spoke up, \"You know nothing at all! You do not realize that it is better for you that one man die for the people than that the whole nation perish.\" He did not say this on his own, but as high priest that year he prophesied that Jesus would die for the Jewish nation, and not only for that nation but also for the scattered children of God, to bring them together and make them one. So from that day on they plotted to take his life. Therefore Jesus no longer moved about publicly among the people of Judea. Instead, he withdrew to a region near the wilderness, to a village called Ephraim, where he stayed with his disciples. When it was almost time for the Jewish Passover, many went up from the country to Jerusalem for their ceremonial cleansing before the Passover. They kept looking for Jesus, and as they stood in the temple courts they asked one another, \"What do you think? Isn't he coming to the festival at all?\" But the chief priests and the Pharisees had given orders that anyone who found out where Jesus was should report it so that they might arrest him."}], "temperature": 0, "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"name": "schema", "schema": {"properties": {"translation": {"type": "string"}}, "required": ["translation"], "type": "object"}}}}}

They made a dinner for him there, and Martha served while Lazarus was among those reclining at the table with him. Mary took a pint of expensive perfume made of pure nard, poured it on Jesus' feet, and wiped his feet with her hair. The house was filled with the fragrance of the perfume.\n\nBut Judas Iscariot, one of his disciples who was later to betray him, objected, \"Why wasn't this perfume sold and the money given to the poor? It was worth a year's wages.\" He did not say this because he cared about the poor but because he was a thief; as keeper of the money bag, he used to help himself to what was put into it.\n\n\"Leave her alone,\" Jesus replied. \"It was intended that she should save this perfume for the day of my burial. You will always have the poor among you, but you will not always have me.\"\n\nMeanwhile, a large crowd of Jews found out that Jesus was there and came, not only because of him but also to see Lazarus, whom he had raised from the dead. So the chief priests made plans to kill Lazarus as well, for on account of him many of the Jews were going over to Jesus and believing in him.\n\nThe next day the great crowd that had come for the festival heard that Jesus was on his way to Jerusalem. They took palm branches and went out to meet him, shouting, \"Hosanna! Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord! Blessed is the king of Israel!\"\n\nJesus found a young donkey and sat on it, as it is written: \"Do not be afraid, Daughter Zion; see, your king is coming, seated on a donkey's colt.\"\n\nAt first, his disciples did not understand all this. Only after Jesus was glorified did they realize that these things had been written about him and that these things had been done to him.\n\nNow the crowd that was with him when he called Lazarus from the tomb and raised him from the dead continued to spread the word. Many people, because they had heard that he had performed this sign, went out to meet him.\n\nSo the Pharisees said to one another, \"See, this is getting us nowhere. Look how the whole world has gone after him!\"\n\nNow there were some Greeks among those who went up to worship at the festival. They came to Philip, who was from Bethsaida in Galilee, with a request. \"Sir,\" they said, \"we would like to see Jesus.\"\n\nPhilip went to tell Andrew; Andrew and Philip in turn told Jesus.\n\nJesus replied, \"The hour has come for the Son of Man to be glorified. Very truly I tell you, unless a kernel of wheat falls to the ground and dies, it remains only a single seed. But if it dies, it produces many seeds. Anyone who loves their life will lose it, while anyone who hates their life in this world will keep it for eternal life. Whoever serves me must follow me; and where I am, my servant also will be. My Father will honor the one who serves me.\n\n\"Now my soul is troubled, and what shall I say? 'Father, save me from this hour'? No, it was for this very reason I came to this hour. Father, glorify your name!\"\n\nThen a voice came from heaven, \"I have glorified it, and will glorify it again.\"\n\nThe crowd that was there and heard it said it had thundered; others said an angel had spoken to him.\n\nJesus said, \"This voice was for your benefit, not mine. Now is the time for judgment on this world; now the prince of this world will be driven out. And I, when I am lifted up from the earth, will draw all people to myself.\" He said this to show the kind of death he was going to die.\n\nThe crowd spoke up, \"We have heard from the Law that the Messiah will remain forever, so how can you say, 'The Son of Man must be lifted up'? Who is this 'Son of Man'?\"\n\nThen Jesus told them, \"You are going to have the light just a little while longer. Walk while you have the light, before darkness overtakes you. Whoever walks in the dark does not know where they are going. Believe in the light while you have the light, so that you may become children of light.\"\n\nWhen he had finished speaking, Jesus left and hid himself from them.\n\nEven after Jesus had performed so many signs in their presence, they still would not believe in him. This was to fulfill the word of Isaiah the prophet: \"Lord, who has believed our message and to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed?\" For this reason, they could not believe, because, as Isaiah says elsewhere: \"He has blinded their eyes and hardened their hearts, so they can neither see with their eyes, nor understand with their hearts, nor turn--and I would heal them.\"\n\nIsaiah said this because he saw Jesus' glory and spoke about him.\n\nYet at the same time many even among the leaders believed in him. But because of the Pharisees they would not openly acknowledge their faith for fear they would be put out of the synagogue; for they loved human praise more than praise from God.\n\nThen Jesus cried out, \"Whoever believes in me does not believe in me only, but in the one who sent me. The one who looks at me is seeing the one who sent me. I have come into the world as a light, so that no one who believes in me should stay in darkness.\n\n\"If anyone hears my words but does not keep them, I do not judge that person. For I did not come to judge the world, but to save the world. There is a judge for the one who rejects me and does not accept my words; the very words I have spoken will condemn them at the last day. For I did not speak on my own, but the Father who sent me commanded me to say all that I have spoken. I know that his command leads to eternal life. So whatever I say is just what the Father has told me to say.\""}], "temperature": 0, "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"name": "schema", "schema": {"properties": {"translation": {"type": "string"}}, "required": ["translation"], "type": "object"}}}}}

He loved his followers in the world and loved them to the end. During supper, the devil had already put it into the heart of Judas Iscariot, Simon's son, to betray him. Jesus knew that the Father had given everything into his hands and that he had come from God and was going back to God. So he got up from the meal, took off his outer clothing, and wrapped a towel around his waist. After that, he poured water into a basin and began to wash his disciples' feet, drying them with the towel that was wrapped around him.\n\nHe came to Simon Peter, who said to him, \"Lord, are you going to wash my feet?\" Jesus replied, \"You do not realize now what I am doing, but later you will understand.\" \"No,\" said Peter, \"you shall never wash my feet.\" Jesus answered, \"Unless I wash you, you have no part with me.\" \"Then, Lord,\" Simon Peter replied, \"not just my feet but my hands and my head as well!\" Jesus answered, \"Those who have had a bath need only to wash their feet; their whole body is clean. And you are clean, though not every one of you.\" For he knew who was going to betray him, and that was why he said not everyone was clean.\n\nWhen he had finished washing their feet, he put on his clothes and returned to his place. \"Do you understand what I have done for you?\" he asked them. \"You call me 'Teacher' and 'Lord,' and rightly so, for that is what I am. Now that I, your Lord and Teacher, have washed your feet, you also should wash one another's feet. I have set you an example that you should do as I have done for you. Very truly I tell you, no servant is greater than his master, nor is a messenger greater than the one who sent him. Now that you know these things, you will be blessed if you do them.\n\nI am not referring to all of you; I know those I have chosen. But this is to fulfill this passage of Scripture: 'He who shared my bread has turned against me.' I am telling you now before it happens, so that when it does happen you will believe that I am who I am. Very truly I tell you, whoever accepts anyone I send accepts me; and whoever accepts me accepts the one who sent me.\"\n\nAfter he had said this, Jesus was troubled in spirit and testified, \"Very truly I tell you, one of you is going to betray me.\" His disciples stared at one another, at a loss to know which of them he meant. One of them, the disciple whom Jesus loved, was reclining next to him. Simon Peter motioned to this disciple and said, \"Ask him which one he means.\" Leaning back against Jesus, he asked him, \"Lord, who is it?\" Jesus answered, \"It is the one to whom I will give this piece of bread when I have dipped it in the dish.\" Then, dipping the piece of bread, he gave it to Judas, the son of Simon Iscariot. As soon as Judas took the bread, Satan entered into him. So Jesus told him, \"What you are about to do, do quickly.\" But no one at the meal understood why Jesus said this to him. Since Judas had charge of the money, some thought Jesus was telling him to buy what was needed for the festival, or to give something to the poor. As soon as Judas had taken the bread, he went out. And it was night.\n\nWhen he was gone, Jesus said, \"Now the Son of Man is glorified and God is glorified in him. If God is glorified in him, God will glorify the Son in himself, and will glorify him at once. My children, I will be with you only a little longer. You will look for me, and just as I told the Jews, so I tell you now: Where I am going, you cannot come. A new command I give you: Love one another. As I have loved you, so you must love one another. By this everyone will know that you are my disciples, if you love one another.\"\n\nSimon Peter asked him, \"Lord, where are you going?\" Jesus replied, \"Where I am going, you cannot follow now, but you will follow later.\" Peter asked, \"Lord, why can't I follow you now? I will lay down my life for you.\" Then Jesus answered, \"Will you really lay down your life for me? Very truly I tell you, before the rooster crows, you will disown me three times.\""}], "temperature": 0, "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"name": "schema", "schema": {"properties": {"translation": {"type": "string"}}, "required": ["translation"], "type": "object"}}}}}

You know the way to the place where I am going.\n\nThomas said to him, \"Lord, we don't know where you are going, so how can we know the way?\"\n\nJesus answered, \"I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me. If you really know me, you will know my Father as well. From now on, you do know him and have seen him.\"\n\nPhilip said, \"Lord, show us the Father and that will be enough for us.\"\n\nJesus answered, \"Don't you know me, Philip, even after I have been among you for such a long time? Anyone who has seen me has seen the Father. How can you say, 'Show us the Father'? Don't you believe that I am in the Father, and that the Father is in me? The words I say to you I do not speak on my own authority. Rather, it is the Father, living in me, who is doing his work.

Just as a branch cannot bear fruit by itself unless it remains in the vine, neither can you unless you remain in me. I am the vine, you are the branches. Whoever remains in me and I in them will bear much fruit, for apart from me you can do nothing. If anyone does not remain in me, they are like a branch that is thrown away and withers; such branches are picked up, thrown into the fire, and burned. If you remain in me and my words remain in you, ask whatever you wish, and it will be done for you. This is to my Father's glory, that you bear much fruit, showing yourselves to be my disciples. As the Father has loved me, so have I loved you. Now remain in my love. If you keep my commands, you will remain in my love, just as I have kept my Father's commands and remain in His love. I have told you this so that my joy may be in you and that your joy may be complete. My command is this: Love each other as I have loved you. Greater love has no one than this: to lay down one's life for one's friends. You are my friends if you do what I command. I no longer call you servants, because a servant does not know his master's business. Instead, I have called you friends, for everything that I learned from my Father I have made known to you. You did not choose me, but I chose you and appointed you so that you might go and bear fruit--fruit that will last--and so that whatever you ask in my name the Father will give you. This is my command: Love each other. If the world hates you, keep in mind that it hated me first. If you belonged to the world, it would love you as its own. As it is, you do not belong to the world, but I have chosen you out of the world. That is why the world hates you. Remember what I told you: 'A servant is not greater than his master.' If they persecuted me, they will persecute you also. If they obeyed my teaching, they will obey yours also. They will treat you this way because of my name, for they do not know the one who sent me. If I had not come and spoken to them, they would not be guilty of sin; but now they have no excuse for their sin. Whoever hates me hates my Father as well. If I had not done among them the works no one else did, they would not be guilty of sin. But now they have seen these works, and yet they have hated both me and my Father. But this is to fulfill what is written in their Law: 'They hated me without reason.'

They will kick you out of the community, and a time will come when anyone who kills you will think they are serving God. They will do these things because they don't know the Father or me. But I have told you this so that when the time comes, you will remember that I warned you. I didn't tell you this from the beginning because I was with you. Now I am going to the one who sent me, and none of you asks me, 'Where are you going?' But because I have said these things, you are filled with sadness. However, I am telling you the truth: it is better for you that I go away. If I don't go, the Helper won't come to you. But if I go, I will send him to you. When he comes, he will show the world what is wrong about sin, righteousness, and judgment. About sin, because they don't believe in me; about righteousness, because I am going to the Father and you won't see me anymore; and about judgment, because the ruler of this world has been judged. I have much more to say to you, but you can't handle it now. But when the Spirit of truth comes, he will guide you into all truth. He won't speak on his own; he will speak only what he hears, and he will tell you what is to come. He will glorify me because he will take from what is mine and make it known to you. Everything that belongs to the Father is mine. That is why I said the Spirit will take from what is mine and make it known to you. In a little while, you won't see me anymore, and then after a little while, you will see me again. Some of his disciples said to each other, 'What does he mean by saying, \"In a little while you won't see me, and then after a little while you will see me,\" and \"because I am going to the Father\"?' They kept asking, 'What does he mean by \"a little while\"? We don't understand what he is saying.' Jesus knew they wanted to ask him about this, so he said to them, 'Are you asking one another what I meant when I said, \"In a little while you won't see me, and then after a little while you will see me\"? Truly, truly, I tell you, you will weep and mourn while the world rejoices. You will grieve, but your grief will turn to joy. A woman giving birth to a child has pain because her time has come, but when her baby is born, she forgets the anguish because of her joy that a child is born into the world. So with you: Now is your time of grief, but I will see you again and you will rejoice, and no one will take away your joy. In that day you will no longer ask me anything. Truly, truly, I tell you, my Father will give you whatever you ask in my name. Until now you have not asked for anything in my name. Ask and you will receive, and your joy will be complete. Though I have been speaking figuratively, a time is coming when I will no longer use this kind of language but will tell you plainly about my Father. In that day you will ask in my name. I am not saying that I will ask the Father on your behalf. No, the Father himself loves you because you have loved me and have believed that I came from God. I came from the Father and entered the world; now I am leaving the world and going back to the Father.' Then Jesus' disciples said, 'Now you are speaking clearly and without figures of speech. Now we can see that you know all things and that you do not even need to have anyone ask you questions. This makes us believe that you came from God.' 'Do you now believe?' Jesus replied. 'A time is coming and in fact has come when you will be scattered, each to your own home. You will leave me all alone. Yet I am not alone, for my Father is with me.

Judas, who was going to betray him, knew the place because Jesus often met there with his disciples. Judas came with soldiers and officials from the chief priests and Pharisees, carrying torches, lanterns, and weapons. Jesus, knowing what was going to happen, stepped forward and asked them, \"Who are you looking for?\" They answered, \"Jesus of Nazareth.\" Jesus said, \"I am he.\" Judas, the one who betrayed him, was standing with them. When Jesus said, \"I am he,\" they drew back and fell to the ground. Again, Jesus asked them, \"Who are you looking for?\" They said, \"Jesus of Nazareth.\" Jesus replied, \"I told you that I am he. If you are looking for me, let these men go.\" This happened so that the words he had spoken would be fulfilled: \"I have not lost one of those you gave me.\" Then Simon Peter, who had a sword, drew it and struck the high priest's servant, cutting off his right ear. The servant's name was Malchus. Jesus said to Peter, \"Put your sword away! Shall I not drink the cup the Father has given me?\" Then the soldiers, their commander, and the Jewish officials arrested Jesus and bound him. They brought him first to Annas, who was the father-in-law of Caiaphas, the high priest that year. Caiaphas was the one who had advised the Jewish leaders that it would be good if one man died for the people. Simon Peter and another disciple were following Jesus. Because this disciple was known to the high priest, he went with Jesus into the high priest's courtyard, but Peter had to wait outside at the door. The other disciple, who was known to the high priest, came back, spoke to the servant girl on duty there, and brought Peter in. \"You aren't one of this man's disciples too, are you?\" she asked Peter. He replied, \"I am not.\" It was cold, and the servants and officials stood around a fire they had made to keep warm. Peter also was standing with them, warming himself. Meanwhile, the high priest questioned Jesus about his disciples and his teaching. \"I have spoken openly to the world,\" Jesus replied. \"I always taught in synagogues or at the temple, where all the Jews come together. I said nothing in secret. Why question me? Ask those who heard me. Surely they know what I said.\" When Jesus said this, one of the officials nearby slapped him in the face. \"Is this the way you answer the high priest?\" he demanded. \"If I said something wrong,\" Jesus replied, \"testify as to what is wrong. But if I spoke the truth, why did you strike me?\" Then Annas sent him bound to Caiaphas the high priest. Meanwhile, Simon Peter was still standing there warming himself. So they asked him, \"You aren't one of his disciples too, are you?\" He denied it, saying, \"I am not.\" One of the high priest's servants, a relative of the man whose ear Peter had cut off, challenged him, \"Didn't I see you with him in the garden?\" Again Peter denied it, and at that moment a rooster began to crow. Then the Jewish leaders took Jesus from Caiaphas to the palace of the Roman governor. By now it was early morning, and to avoid ceremonial uncleanness they did not enter the palace, because they wanted to be able to eat the Passover. So Pilate came out to them and asked, \"What charges are you bringing against this man?\" \"If he were not a criminal,\" they replied, \"we would not have handed him over to you.\" Pilate said, \"Take him yourselves and judge him by your own law.\" \"But we have no right to execute anyone,\" they objected. This took place to fulfill what Jesus had said about the kind of death he was going to die. Pilate then went back inside the palace, summoned Jesus, and asked him, \"Are you the king of the Jews?\" \"Is that your own idea,\" Jesus asked, \"or did others talk to you about me?\" \"Am I a Jew?\" Pilate replied. \"Your own people and chief priests handed you over to me. What is it you have done?\" Jesus said, \"My kingdom is not of this world. If it were, my servants would fight to prevent my arrest by the Jewish leaders. But now my kingdom is from another place.\" \"You are a king, then!\" said Pilate. Jesus answered, \"You say that I am a king. In fact, the reason I was born and came into the world is to testify to the truth. Everyone on the side of truth listens to me.\" \"What is truth?\" retorted Pilate. With this, he went out again to the Jews gathered there and said, \"I find no basis for a charge against him. But it is your custom for me to release to you one prisoner at the time of the Passover. Do you want me to release 'the king of the Jews'?\" They shouted back, \"No, not him! Give us Barabbas!\" Now Barabbas had taken part in an uprising."}], "temperature": 0, "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"name": "schema", "schema": {"properties": {"translation": {"type": "string"}}, "required": ["translation"], "type": "object"}}}}}

The soldiers made a crown of thorns and put it on his head, and they dressed him in a purple robe. They came up to him and said, \"Hail, King of the Jews!\" and slapped him in the face. Pilate went out again and said to them, \"Look, I am bringing him out to you to let you know that I find no basis for a charge against him.\" When Jesus came out wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe, Pilate said to them, \"Here is the man!\" When the chief priests and their officials saw him, they shouted, \"Crucify! Crucify!\" But Pilate answered, \"You take him and crucify him. As for me, I find no basis for a charge against him.\" The Jewish leaders insisted, \"We have a law, and according to that law he must die, because he claimed to be the Son of God.\" When Pilate heard this, he was even more afraid, and he went back inside the palace. \"Where do you come from?\" he asked Jesus, but Jesus gave him no answer. \"Do you refuse to speak to me?\" Pilate said. \"Don't you realize I have power either to free you or to crucify you?\" Jesus answered, \"You would have no power over me if it were not given to you from above. Therefore the one who handed me over to you is guilty of a greater sin.\" From then on, Pilate tried to set Jesus free, but the Jewish leaders kept shouting, \"If you let this man go, you are no friend of Caesar. Anyone who claims to be a king opposes Caesar.\" When Pilate heard this, he brought Jesus out and sat down on the judge's seat at a place known as the Stone Pavement (which in Aramaic is Gabbatha). It was the day of Preparation of the Passover; it was about noon. \"Here is your king,\" Pilate said to the Jews. But they shouted, \"Take him away! Take him away! Crucify him!\" \"Shall I crucify your king?\" Pilate asked. \"We have no king but Caesar,\" the chief priests answered. Finally, Pilate handed him over to them to be crucified. So the soldiers took charge of Jesus. Carrying his own cross, he went out to the place of the Skull (which in Aramaic is called Golgotha). There they crucified him, and with him two others--one on each side and Jesus in the middle. Pilate had a notice prepared and fastened to the cross. It read: JESUS OF NAZARETH, THE KING OF THE JEWS. Many of the Jews read this sign, for the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city, and the sign was written in Aramaic, Latin, and Greek. The chief priests of the Jews protested to Pilate, \"Do not write 'The King of the Jews,' but that this man claimed to be king of the Jews.\" Pilate answered, \"What I have written, I have written.\" When the soldiers crucified Jesus, they took his clothes, dividing them into four shares, one for each of them, with the undergarment remaining. This garment was seamless, woven in one piece from top to bottom. \"Let's not tear it,\" they said to one another. \"Let's decide by lot who will get it.\" This happened that the scripture might be fulfilled that said, \"They divided my clothes among them and cast lots for my garment.\" So this is what the soldiers did. Near the cross of Jesus stood his mother, his mother's sister, Mary the wife of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene. When Jesus saw his mother there, and the disciple whom he loved standing nearby, he said to her, \"Woman, here is your son,\" and to the disciple, \"Here is your mother.\" From that time on, this disciple took her into his home. Later, knowing that everything had now been finished, and so that Scripture would be fulfilled, Jesus said, \"I am thirsty.\" A jar of wine vinegar was there, so they soaked a sponge in it, put the sponge on a stalk of the hyssop plant, and lifted it to Jesus' lips. When he had received the drink, Jesus said, \"It is finished.\" With that, he bowed his head and gave up his spirit. Now it was the day of Preparation, and the next day was to be a special Sabbath. Because the Jewish leaders did not want the bodies left on the crosses during the Sabbath, they asked Pilate to have the legs broken and the bodies taken down. The soldiers therefore came and broke the legs of the first man who had been crucified with Jesus, and then those of the other. But when they came to Jesus and found that he was already dead, they did not break his legs. Instead, one of the soldiers pierced Jesus' side with a spear, bringing a sudden flow of blood and water. The man who saw it has given testimony, and his testimony is true. He knows that he tells the truth, and he testifies so that you also may believe. These things happened so that the scripture would be fulfilled: \"Not one of his bones will be broken,\" and, as another scripture says, \"They will look on the one they have pierced.\" Later, Joseph of Arimathea asked Pilate for the body of Jesus. Now Joseph was a disciple of Jesus, but secretly because he feared the Jewish leaders. With Pilate's permission, he came and took the body away. He was accompanied by Nicodemus, the man who earlier had visited Jesus at night. Nicodemus brought a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about seventy-five pounds. Taking Jesus' body, the two of them wrapped it, with the spices, in strips of linen. This was in accordance with Jewish burial customs. At the place where Jesus was crucified, there was a garden, and in the garden a new tomb, in which no one had ever been laid. Because it was the Jewish day of Preparation and since the tomb was nearby, they laid Jesus there."}], "temperature": 0, "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"name": "schema", "schema": {"properties": {"translation": {"type": "string"}}, "required": ["translation"], "type": "object"}}}}}

She saw that the stone had been removed from the entrance. So she ran to Simon Peter and the other disciple, the one Jesus loved, and said, \"They have taken the Lord out of the tomb, and we don't know where they have put him!\" So Peter and the other disciple started for the tomb. Both were running, but the other disciple outran Peter and reached the tomb first. He bent over and looked in at the strips of linen lying there but did not go in. Then Simon Peter came along behind him and went straight into the tomb. He saw the strips of linen lying there, as well as the cloth that had been wrapped around Jesus' head. The cloth was still lying in its place, separate from the linen. Finally, the other disciple, who had reached the tomb first, also went inside. He saw and believed. (They still did not understand from Scripture that Jesus had to rise from the dead.) Then the disciples went back to where they were staying.\n\nNow Mary stood outside the tomb crying. As she wept, she bent over to look into the tomb and saw two angels in white, seated where Jesus' body had been, one at the head and the other at the foot. They asked her, \"Woman, why are you crying?\"\n\n\"They have taken my Lord away,\" she said, \"and I don't know where they have put him.\" At this, she turned around and saw Jesus standing there, but she did not realize that it was Jesus.\n\nHe asked her, \"Woman, why are you crying? Who is it you are looking for?\"\n\nThinking he was the gardener, she said, \"Sir, if you have carried him away, tell me where you have put him, and I will get him.\"\n\nJesus said to her, \"Mary.\"\n\nShe turned toward him and cried out in Aramaic, \"Rabboni!\" (which means \"Teacher\").\n\nJesus said, \"Do not hold on to me, for I have not yet ascended to the Father. Go instead to my brothers and tell them, 'I am ascending to my Father and your Father, to my God and your God.'\"\n\nMary Magdalene went to the disciples with the news: \"I have seen the Lord!\" And she told them that he had said these things to her.\n\nOn the evening of that first day of the week, when the disciples were together, with the doors locked for fear of the Jewish leaders, Jesus came and stood among them and said, \"Peace be with you!\" After he said this, he showed them his hands and side. The disciples were overjoyed when they saw the Lord.\n\nAgain Jesus said, \"Peace be with you! As the Father has sent me, I am sending you.\" And with that he breathed on them and said, \"Receive the Holy Spirit. If you forgive anyone's sins, their sins are forgiven; if you do not forgive them, they are not forgiven.\"\n\nNow Thomas (also known as Didymus), one of the Twelve, was not with the disciples when Jesus came. So the other disciples told him, \"We have seen the Lord!\"\n\nBut he said to them, \"Unless I see the nail marks in his hands and put my finger where the nails were, and put my hand into his side, I will not believe.\"\n\nA week later his disciples were in the house again, and Thomas was with them. Though the doors were locked, Jesus came and stood among them and said, \"Peace be with you!\" Then he said to Thomas, \"Put your finger here; see my hands. Reach out your hand and put it into my side. Stop doubting and believe.\"\n\nThomas said to him, \"My Lord and my God!\"\n\nThen Jesus told him, \"Because you have seen me, you have believed; blessed are those who have not seen and yet have believed.\"\n\nJesus performed many other signs in the presence of his disciples, which are not recorded in this book.

This is how it happened: Simon Peter, Thomas (also called the Twin), Nathanael from Cana in Galilee, the sons of Zebedee, and two other disciples were together. Simon Peter said to them, \"I'm going fishing.\" They said, \"We'll go with you.\" So they went out and got into the boat, but that night they caught nothing.\n\nEarly in the morning, Jesus stood on the shore, but the disciples did not realize it was him. He called out to them, \"Friends, haven't you any fish?\" \"No,\" they answered. He said, \"Throw your net on the right side of the boat and you will find some.\" When they did, they were unable to haul the net in because of the large number of fish.\n\nThen the disciple whom Jesus loved said to Peter, \"It is the Lord!\" As soon as Simon Peter heard him say, \"It is the Lord,\" he wrapped his outer garment around him (for he had taken it off) and jumped into the water. The other disciples followed in the boat, towing the net full of fish, for they were not far from shore, about a hundred yards.\n\nWhen they landed, they saw a fire of burning coals there with fish on it, and some bread. Jesus said to them, \"Bring some of the fish you have just caught.\" So Simon Peter climbed back into the boat and dragged the net ashore. It was full of large fish, 153, but even with so many the net was not torn.\n\nJesus said to them, \"Come and have breakfast.\" None of the disciples dared ask him, \"Who are you?\" They knew it was the Lord. Jesus came, took the bread and gave it to them, and did the same with the fish. This was now the third time Jesus appeared to his disciples after he was raised from the dead.\n\nWhen they had finished eating, Jesus said to Simon Peter, \"Simon son of John, do you love me more than these?\" \"Yes, Lord,\" he said, \"you know that I love you.\" Jesus said, \"Feed my lambs.\"\n\nAgain Jesus said, \"Simon son of John, do you love me?\" He answered, \"Yes, Lord, you know that I love you.\" Jesus said, \"Take care of my sheep.\"\n\nThe third time he said to him, \"Simon son of John, do you love me?\" Peter was hurt because Jesus asked him the third time, \"Do you love me?\" He said, \"Lord, you know all things; you know that I love you.\" Jesus said, \"Feed my sheep.\n\nVery truly I tell you, when you were younger you dressed yourself and went where you wanted; but when you are old you will stretch out your hands, and someone else will dress you and lead you where you do not want to go.\" Jesus said this to indicate the kind of death by which Peter would glorify God. Then he said to him, \"Follow me!\"\n\nPeter turned and saw the disciple whom Jesus loved was following them. This was the one who had leaned back against Jesus at the supper and had said, \"Lord, who is going to betray you?\" When Peter saw him, he asked, \"Lord, what about him?\"\n\nJesus answered, \"If I want him to remain alive until I return, what is that to you? You must follow me.\" Because of this, the rumor spread among the believers that this disciple would not die. But Jesus did not say that he would not die; he only said, \"If I want him to remain alive until I return, what is that to you?\"\n\nThis is the disciple who testifies to these things and who wrote them down. We know that his testimony is true. Jesus did many other things as well. If every one of them were written down, I suppose that even the whole world would not have room for the books that would be written."}], "temperature": 0, "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"name": "schema", "schema": {"properties": {"translation": {"type": "string"}}, "required": ["translation"], "type": "object"}}}}}

They were both righteous before God, living blamelessly according to all the commandments and regulations of the Lord. But they had no child because Elizabeth was barren, and both were advanced in years.\n\nWhile Zechariah was serving as a priest before God in the order of his division, it was his turn to enter the temple of the Lord and burn incense. And the whole assembly of people was praying outside at the hour of incense. Then an angel of the Lord appeared to him, standing at the right side of the altar of incense. Zechariah was troubled when he saw him, and fear fell upon him.\n\nBut the angel said to him, \"Do not be afraid, Zechariah, for your prayer has been heard, and your wife Elizabeth will bear you a son, and you shall call his name John. You will have joy and gladness, and many will rejoice at his birth, for he will be great before the Lord. He must not drink wine or strong drink, and he will be filled with the Holy Spirit even from his mother's womb. He will turn many of the children of Israel to the Lord their God, and he will go before him in the spirit and power of Elijah, to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just, to make ready for the Lord a people prepared.\"\n\nZechariah said to the angel, \"How shall I know this? For I am an old man, and my wife is advanced in years.\" The angel answered him, \"I am Gabriel. I stand in the presence of God, and I was sent to speak to you and to bring you this good news. And behold, you will be silent and unable to speak until the day that these things take place, because you did not believe my words, which will be fulfilled in their time.\"\n\nThe people were waiting for Zechariah, and they were wondering at his delay in the temple. When he came out, he was unable to speak to them, and they realized that he had seen a vision in the temple. He kept making signs to them and remained mute.\n\nWhen his time of service was completed, he returned home. After this, his wife Elizabeth became pregnant and for five months remained in seclusion. \"The Lord has done this for me,\" she said. \"In these days he has shown his favor and taken away my disgrace among the people.\"\n\nIn the sixth month, God sent the angel Gabriel to Nazareth, a town in Galilee, to a virgin pledged to be married to a man named Joseph, a descendant of David. The virgin's name was Mary. The angel went to her and said, \"Greetings, you who are highly favored! The Lord is with you.\" Mary was greatly troubled at his words and wondered what kind of greeting this might be.\n\nBut the angel said to her, \"Do not be afraid, Mary, you have found favor with God. You will conceive and give birth to a son, and you are to call him Jesus. He will be great and will be called the Son of the Most High. The Lord God will give him the throne of his father David, and he will reign over Jacob's descendants forever; his kingdom will never end.\"\n\n\"How will this be,\" Mary asked the angel, \"since I am a virgin?\"\n\nThe angel answered, \"The Holy Spirit will come on you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you. So the holy one to be born will be called the Son of God. Even Elizabeth your relative is going to have a child in her old age, and she who was said to be unable to conceive is in her sixth month. For no word from God will ever fail.\"\n\n\"I am the Lord's servant,\" Mary answered. \"May your word to me be fulfilled.\" Then the angel left her.\n\nAt that time Mary got ready and hurried to a town in the hill country of Judea, where she entered Zechariah's home and greeted Elizabeth. When Elizabeth heard Mary's greeting, the baby leaped in her womb, and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit. In a loud voice she exclaimed: \"Blessed are you among women, and blessed is the child you will bear! But why am I so favored, that the mother of my Lord should come to me? As soon as the sound of your greeting reached my ears, the baby in my womb leaped for joy. Blessed is she who has believed that the Lord would fulfill his promises to her!\"\n\nAnd Mary said: \"My soul glorifies the Lord and my spirit rejoices in God my Savior, for he has been mindful of the humble state of his servant. From now on all generations will call me blessed, for the Mighty One has done great things for me--holy is his name. His mercy extends to those who fear him, from generation to generation. He has performed mighty deeds with his arm; he has scattered those who are proud in their inmost thoughts. He has brought down rulers from their thrones but has lifted up the humble. He has filled the hungry with good things but has sent the rich away empty. He has helped his servant Israel, remembering to be merciful to Abraham and his descendants forever, just as he promised our ancestors.\"\n\nMary stayed with Elizabeth for about three months and then returned home. When it was time for Elizabeth to have her baby, she gave birth to a son. Her neighbors and relatives heard that the Lord had shown her great mercy, and they shared her joy.\n\nOn the eighth day, they came to circumcise the child, and they were going to name him after his father Zechariah, but his mother spoke up and said, \"No! He is to be called John.\" They said to her, \"There is no one among your relatives who has that name.\" Then they made signs to his father, to find out what he would like to name the child. He asked for a writing tablet, and to everyone's astonishment, he wrote, \"His name is John.\" Immediately his mouth was opened and his tongue set free, and he began to speak, praising God.\n\nAll the neighbors were filled with awe, and throughout the hill country of Judea, people were talking about all these things. Everyone who heard this wondered about it, asking, \"What then is this child going to be?\" For the Lord's hand was with him.\n\nHis father Zechariah was filled with the Holy Spirit and prophesied: \"Praise be to the Lord, the God of Israel, because he has come to his people and redeemed them. He has raised up a horn of salvation for us in the house of his servant David (as he said through his holy prophets of long ago), salvation from our enemies and from the hand of all who hate us--to show mercy to our ancestors and to remember his holy covenant, the oath he swore to our father Abraham: to rescue us from the hand of our enemies, and to enable us to serve him without fear in holiness and righteousness before him all our days.\n\nAnd you, my child, will be called a prophet of the Most High; for you will go on before the Lord to prepare the way for him, to give his people the knowledge of salvation through the forgiveness of their sins, because of the tender mercy of our God, by which the rising sun will come to us from heaven to shine on those living in darkness and in the shadow of death, to guide our feet into the path of peace.\"\n\nAnd the child grew and became strong in spirit, and he lived in the wilderness until he appeared publicly to Israel."}], "temperature": 0, "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"name": "schema", "schema": {"properties": {"translation": {"type": "string"}}, "required": ["translation"], "type": "object"}}}}}

This was the first registration when Quirinius was governor of Syria. Everyone went to their own town to register. Joseph also went from the town of Nazareth in Galilee to Judea, to the city of David called Bethlehem, because he was from the house and family of David. He went to be registered with Mary, who was engaged to him and was expecting a child. While they were there, the time came for her to give birth, and she had her firstborn son. She wrapped him in cloths and laid him in a manger because there was no room for them in the inn.\n\nShepherds were in the fields nearby, keeping watch over their flocks at night. An angel of the Lord appeared to them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them, and they were terrified. But the angel said to them, \"Do not be afraid. I bring you good news of great joy for all people. Today in the city of David, a Savior has been born to you; he is Christ the Lord. This will be a sign to you: You will find a baby wrapped in cloths and lying in a manger.\" Suddenly, a great company of the heavenly host appeared with the angel, praising God and saying, \"Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace to those on whom his favor rests.\"\n\nWhen the angels had left them and gone into heaven, the shepherds said to one another, \"Let's go to Bethlehem and see this thing that has happened, which the Lord has told us about.\" So they hurried off and found Mary and Joseph, and the baby, who was lying in the manger. When they had seen him, they spread the word about what had been told them about this child, and all who heard it were amazed at what the shepherds said to them. But Mary treasured up all these things and pondered them in her heart. The shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all the things they had heard and seen, which were just as they had been told.\n\nOn the eighth day, when it was time to circumcise the child, he was named Jesus, the name the angel had given him before he was conceived. When the time came for their purification according to the Law of Moses, they took him to Jerusalem to present him to the Lord, as it is written in the Law of the Lord, \"Every firstborn male is to be consecrated to the Lord,\" and to offer a sacrifice in keeping with what is said in the Law of the Lord: \"a pair of doves or two young pigeons.\"\n\nNow there was a man in Jerusalem called Simeon, who was righteous and devout. He was waiting for the consolation of Israel, and the Holy Spirit was on him. It had been revealed to him by the Holy Spirit that he would not die before he had seen the Lord's Messiah. Moved by the Spirit, he went into the temple courts. When the parents brought in the child Jesus to do for him what the custom of the Law required, Simeon took him in his arms and praised God, saying, \"Sovereign Lord, as you have promised, you may now dismiss your servant in peace. For my eyes have seen your salvation, which you have prepared in the sight of all nations: a light for revelation to the Gentiles, and the glory of your people Israel.\"\n\nThe child's father and mother marveled at what was said about him. Then Simeon blessed them and said to Mary, his mother, \"This child is destined to cause the falling and rising of many in Israel, and to be a sign that will be spoken against, so that the thoughts of many hearts will be revealed. And a sword will pierce your own soul too.\"\n\nThere was also a prophet, Anna, the daughter of Penuel, of the tribe of Asher. She was very old; she had lived with her husband seven years after her marriage, and then was a widow until she was eighty-four. She never left the temple but worshiped night and day, fasting and praying. Coming up to them at that very moment, she gave thanks to God and spoke about the child to all who were looking forward to the redemption of Jerusalem.\n\nWhen Joseph and Mary had done everything required by the Law of the Lord, they returned to Galilee, to their own town of Nazareth. And the child grew and became strong; he was filled with wisdom, and the grace of God was on him.\n\nEvery year Jesus' parents went to Jerusalem for the Festival of the Passover. When he was twelve years old, they went up to the festival, according to the custom. After the festival was over, while his parents were returning home, the boy Jesus stayed behind in Jerusalem, but they were unaware of it. Thinking he was in their company, they traveled on for a day. Then they began looking for him among their relatives and friends. When they did not find him, they went back to Jerusalem to look for him. After three days, they found him in the temple courts, sitting among the teachers, listening to them and asking them questions. Everyone who heard him was amazed at his understanding and his answers.\n\nWhen his parents saw him, they were astonished. His mother said to him, \"Son, why have you treated us like this? Your father and I have been anxiously searching for you.\"\n\n\"Why were you searching for me?\" he asked. \"Didn't you know I had to be in my Father's house?\" But they did not understand what he was saying to them.\n\nThen he went down to Nazareth with them and was obedient to them. But his mother treasured all these things in her heart.

He went into all the region around the Jordan, preaching a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins, as it is written in the book of the words of Isaiah the prophet: \"A voice of one calling in the wilderness, 'Prepare the way for the Lord, make straight paths for him. Every valley shall be filled in, every mountain and hill made low. The crooked roads shall become straight, the rough ways smooth. And all people will see God's salvation.'\"\n\nJohn said to the crowds coming out to be baptized by him, \"You brood of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the coming wrath? Produce fruit in keeping with repentance. And do not begin to say to yourselves, 'We have Abraham as our father.' For I tell you that out of these stones God can raise up children for Abraham. The ax is already at the root of the trees, and every tree that does not produce good fruit will be cut down and thrown into the fire.\"\n\nThe crowds asked him, \"What should we do then?\"\n\nJohn answered, \"Anyone who has two shirts should share with the one who has none, and anyone who has food should do the same.\"\n\nEven tax collectors came to be baptized. \"Teacher,\" they asked, \"what should we do?\"\n\n\"Don't collect any more than you are required to,\" he told them.\n\nThen some soldiers asked him, \"And what should we do?\"\n\nHe replied, \"Don't extort money and don't accuse people falsely--be content with your pay.\"\n\nThe people were waiting expectantly and were all wondering in their hearts if John might possibly be the Messiah. John answered them all, \"I baptize you with water. But one who is more powerful than I will come, the straps of whose sandals I am not worthy to untie. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire. His winnowing fork is in his hand to clear his threshing floor and to gather the wheat into his barn, but he will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire.\" And with many other words John exhorted the people and proclaimed the good news to them.\n\nBut when John rebuked Herod the tetrarch because of his marriage to Herodias, his brother's wife, and all the other evil things he had done, Herod added this to them all: He locked John up in prison.\n\nWhen all the people were being baptized, Jesus was baptized too. And as he was praying, heaven was opened and the Holy Spirit descended on him in bodily form like a dove. And a voice came from heaven: \"You are my Son, whom I love; with you I am well pleased.\"\n\nNow Jesus himself was about thirty years old when he began his ministry.

He said, \"I will give you all their authority and glory, for it has been given to me, and I can give it to anyone I want. If you worship me, it will all be yours.\" Jesus replied, \"It is written: 'Worship the Lord your God and serve him only.'\"\n\nThe devil then took him to Jerusalem and had him stand on the highest point of the temple. \"If you are the Son of God,\" he said, \"throw yourself down from here. For it is written: 'He will command his angels concerning you to guard you carefully; they will lift you up in their hands, so that you will not strike your foot against a stone.'\" Jesus answered, \"It is said: 'Do not put the Lord your God to the test.'\"\n\nWhen the devil had finished all this tempting, he left him until an opportune time. Jesus returned to Galilee in the power of the Spirit, and news about him spread through the whole countryside. He was teaching in their synagogues, and everyone praised him.\n\nHe went to Nazareth, where he had been brought up, and on the Sabbath day he went into the synagogue, as was his custom. He stood up to read, and the scroll of the prophet Isaiah was handed to him. Unrolling it, he found the place where it is written: \"The Spirit of the Lord is on me, because he has anointed me to proclaim good news to the poor. He has sent me to proclaim freedom for the prisoners and recovery of sight for the blind, to set the oppressed free, to proclaim the year of the Lord's favor.\"\n\nThen he rolled up the scroll, gave it back to the attendant, and sat down. The eyes of everyone in the synagogue were fastened on him. He began by saying to them, \"Today this scripture is fulfilled in your hearing.\" All spoke well of him and were amazed at the gracious words that came from his lips. \"Isn't this Joseph's son?\" they asked.\n\nJesus said to them, \"Surely you will quote this proverb to me: 'Physician, heal yourself!' And you will tell me, 'Do here in your hometown what we have heard that you did in Capernaum.'\" \"Truly I tell you,\" he continued, \"no prophet is accepted in his hometown. I assure you that there were many widows in Israel in Elijah's time, when the sky was shut for three and a half years and there was a severe famine throughout the land. Yet Elijah was not sent to any of them, but to a widow in Zarephath in the region of Sidon. And there were many in Israel with leprosy in the time of Elisha the prophet, yet not one of them was cleansed--only Naaman the Syrian.\"\n\nAll the people in the synagogue were furious when they heard this. They got up, drove him out of the town, and took him to the brow of the hill on which the town was built, in order to throw him off the cliff. But he walked right through the crowd and went on his way.\n\nThen he went down to Capernaum, a town in Galilee, and on the Sabbath he taught the people. They were amazed at his teaching, because his words had authority. In the synagogue, there was a man possessed by a demon, an impure spirit. He cried out at the top of his voice, \"Go away! What do you want with us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are--the Holy One of God!\"\n\n\"Be quiet!\" Jesus said sternly. \"Come out of him!\" Then the demon threw the man down before them all and came out without injuring him. All the people were amazed and said to each other, \"What words these are! With authority and power he gives orders to impure spirits and they come out!\" And the news about him spread throughout the surrounding area.\n\nJesus left the synagogue and went to the home of Simon. Now Simon's mother-in-law was suffering from a high fever, and they asked Jesus to help her. So he bent over her and rebuked the fever, and it left her. She got up at once and began to wait on them.\n\nAt sunset, the people brought to Jesus all who had various kinds of sickness, and laying his hands on each one, he healed them. Moreover, demons came out of many people, shouting, \"You are the Son of God!\" But he rebuked them and would not allow them to speak, because they knew he was the Messiah.\n\nAt daybreak, Jesus went out to a solitary place. The people were looking for him and when they came to where he was, they tried to keep him from leaving them. But he said, \"I must proclaim the good news of the kingdom of God to the other towns also, because that is why I was sent.\" And he kept on preaching in the synagogues of Judea."}], "temperature": 0, "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"name": "schema", "schema": {"properties": {"translation": {"type": "string"}}, "required": ["translation"], "type": "object"}}}}}

He saw two boats by the lake, and the fishermen had left them to wash their nets. Jesus got into one of the boats, which belonged to Simon, and asked him to push it out a little from the shore. Then he sat down and taught the people from the boat.\n\nWhen he finished speaking, he told Simon, \"Go out into the deep water and let down your nets for a catch.\" Simon replied, \"Master, we've worked hard all night and haven't caught anything. But because you say so, I will let down the nets.\" When they did, they caught such a large number of fish that their nets began to break. They signaled to their partners in the other boat to come and help them, and they came and filled both boats so full that they began to sink.\n\nWhen Simon Peter saw this, he fell at Jesus' knees and said, \"Go away from me, Lord; I am a sinful man!\" For he and all his companions were astonished at the catch of fish they had taken, and so were James and John, the sons of Zebedee, Simon's partners. Then Jesus said to Simon, \"Don't be afraid; from now on you will fish for people.\" So they pulled their boats up on shore, left everything, and followed him.\n\nWhile Jesus was in one of the towns, a man covered with leprosy saw him and fell with his face to the ground and begged him, \"Lord, if you are willing, you can make me clean.\" Jesus reached out his hand and touched the man. \"I am willing,\" he said. \"Be clean!\" And immediately the leprosy left him. Then Jesus ordered him, \"Don't tell anyone, but go, show yourself to the priest and offer the sacrifices that Moses commanded for your cleansing, as a testimony to them.\"\n\nYet the news about him spread all the more, so that crowds of people came to hear him and to be healed of their sicknesses. But Jesus often withdrew to lonely places and prayed.\n\nOne day Jesus was teaching, and Pharisees and teachers of the law were sitting there. They had come from every village of Galilee and from Judea and Jerusalem. And the power of the Lord was with Jesus to heal the sick. Some men came carrying a paralyzed man on a mat and tried to take him into the house to lay him before Jesus. When they could not find a way to do this because of the crowd, they went up on the roof and lowered him on his mat through the tiles into the middle of the crowd, right in front of Jesus.\n\nWhen Jesus saw their faith, he said, \"Friend, your sins are forgiven.\" The Pharisees and the teachers of the law began thinking to themselves, \"Who is this fellow who speaks blasphemy? Who can forgive sins but God alone?\" Jesus knew what they were thinking and asked, \"Why are you thinking these things in your hearts? Which is easier: to say, 'Your sins are forgiven,' or to say, 'Get up and walk'? But I want you to know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins.\" So he said to the paralyzed man, \"I tell you, get up, take your mat and go home.\" Immediately he stood up in front of them, took what he had been lying on, and went home praising God.\n\nEveryone was amazed and gave praise to God. They were filled with awe and said, \"We have seen remarkable things today.\"\n\nAfter this, Jesus went out and saw a tax collector by the name of Levi sitting at his tax booth. \"Follow me,\" Jesus said to him, and Levi got up, left everything and followed him.\n\nThen Levi held a great banquet for Jesus at his house, and a large crowd of tax collectors and others were eating with them. But the Pharisees and the teachers of the law who belonged to their sect complained to his disciples, \"Why do you eat and drink with tax collectors and sinners?\" Jesus answered them, \"It is not the healthy who need a doctor, but the sick. I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.\"\n\nThey said to him, \"John's disciples often fast and pray, and so do the disciples of the Pharisees, but yours go on eating and drinking.\" Jesus answered, \"Can you make the friends of the bridegroom fast while he is with them? But the time will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them; in those days they will fast.\"\n\nHe told them this parable: \"No one tears a piece out of a new garment to patch an old one. Otherwise, they will have torn the new garment, and the patch from the new will not match the old. And no one pours new wine into old wineskins. Otherwise, the new wine will burst the skins; the wine will run out and the wineskins will be ruined. No, new wine must be poured into new wineskins. And no one after drinking old wine wants the new, for they say, 'The old is better.'\""}], "temperature": 0, "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"name": "schema", "schema": {"properties": {"translation": {"type": "string"}}, "required": ["translation"], "type": "object"}}}}}

Some Pharisees asked, \"Why are you doing what is not lawful on the Sabbath?\" Jesus answered, \"Haven't you read what David did when he and his companions were hungry? He entered the house of God, took the consecrated bread, ate it, and gave some to his companions, even though it is only lawful for priests to eat.\" Then he said to them, \"The Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath.\"\n\nOn another Sabbath, Jesus went into the synagogue and was teaching, and a man was there whose right hand was shriveled. The teachers of the law and the Pharisees were watching him closely to see if he would heal on the Sabbath, so they could accuse him. But Jesus knew what they were thinking and said to the man with the shriveled hand, \"Get up and stand in front of everyone.\" So he got up and stood there. Then Jesus said to them, \"I ask you, which is lawful on the Sabbath: to do good or to do evil, to save life or to destroy it?\" He looked around at them all and then said to the man, \"Stretch out your hand.\" He did so, and his hand was completely restored. But the Pharisees and the teachers of the law were furious and began to discuss with one another what they might do to Jesus.\n\nOne of those days, Jesus went out to a mountainside to pray, and spent the night praying to God. When morning came, he called his disciples to him and chose twelve of them, whom he also designated apostles: Simon (whom he named Peter), his brother Andrew, James, John, Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew, Thomas, James son of Alphaeus, Simon who was called the Zealot, Judas son of James, and Judas Iscariot, who became a traitor.\n\nHe went down with them and stood on a level place. A large crowd of his disciples was there and a great number of people from all over Judea, from Jerusalem, and from the coastal region around Tyre and Sidon, who had come to hear him and to be healed of their diseases. Those troubled by impure spirits were cured, and the people all tried to touch him, because power was coming from him and healing them all.\n\nLooking at his disciples, he said: \"Blessed are you who are poor, for yours is the kingdom of God. Blessed are you who hunger now, for you will be satisfied. Blessed are you who weep now, for you will laugh. Blessed are you when people hate you, when they exclude you and insult you and reject your name as evil, because of the Son of Man. Rejoice in that day and leap for joy, because great is your reward in heaven. For that is how their ancestors treated the prophets.\n\nBut woe to you who are rich, for you have already received your comfort. Woe to you who are well fed now, for you will go hungry. Woe to you who laugh now, for you will mourn and weep. Woe to you when everyone speaks well of you, for that is how their ancestors treated the false prophets.\n\nBut to you who are listening I say: Love your enemies, do good to those who hate you, bless those who curse you, pray for those who mistreat you. If someone slaps you on one cheek, turn to them the other also. If someone takes your coat, do not withhold your shirt from them. Give to everyone who asks you, and if anyone takes what belongs to you, do not demand it back. Do to others as you would have them do to you.\n\nIf you love those who love you, what credit is that to you? Even sinners love those who love them. And if you do good to those who are good to you, what credit is that to you? Even sinners do that. And if you lend to those from whom you expect repayment, what credit is that to you? Even sinners lend to sinners, expecting to be repaid in full. But love your enemies, do good to them, and lend to them without expecting to get anything back. Then your reward will be great, and you will be children of the Most High, because he is kind to the ungrateful and wicked. Be merciful, just as your Father is merciful.\n\nDo not judge, and you will not be judged. Do not condemn, and you will not be condemned. Forgive, and you will be forgiven. Give, and it will be given to you. A good measure, pressed down, shaken together and running over, will be poured into your lap. For with the measure you use, it will be measured to you.\"\n\nHe also told them this parable: \"Can the blind lead the blind? Will they not both fall into a pit? The student is not above the teacher, but everyone who is fully trained will be like their teacher.\n\nWhy do you look at the speck of sawdust in your brother's eye and pay no attention to the plank in your own eye? How can you say to your brother, 'Brother, let me take the speck out of your eye,' when you yourself fail to see the plank in your own eye? You hypocrite, first take the plank out of your eye, and then you will see clearly to remove the speck from your brother's eye.\n\nNo good tree bears bad fruit, nor does a bad tree bear good fruit. Each tree is recognized by its own fruit. People do not pick figs from thornbushes, or grapes from briers. A good man brings good things out of the good stored up in his heart, and an evil man brings evil things out of the evil stored up in his heart. For the mouth speaks what the heart is full of.\n\nWhy do you call me, 'Lord, Lord,' and do not do what I say? As for everyone who comes to me and hears my words and puts them into practice, I will show you what they are like. They are like a man building a house, who dug down deep and laid the foundation on rock. When a flood came, the torrent struck that house but could not shake it, because it was well built. But the one who hears my words and does not put them into practice is like a man who built a house on the ground without a foundation. The moment the torrent struck that house, it collapsed and its destruction was complete.\""}], "temperature": 0, "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"name": "schema", "schema": {"properties": {"translation": {"type": "string"}}, "required": ["translation"], "type": "object"}}}}}

There, a Roman officer had a servant who was very sick and about to die. The officer valued this servant highly. When he heard about Jesus, he sent some Jewish elders to ask Jesus to come and heal his servant. The elders went to Jesus and pleaded with him, saying, \"This man deserves your help because he loves our nation and has built our synagogue.\"\n\nSo Jesus went with them. When he was not far from the house, the officer sent friends to say to him, \"Lord, don't trouble yourself, for I am not worthy to have you come under my roof. That is why I did not even consider myself worthy to come to you. But just say the word, and my servant will be healed. For I myself am a man under authority, with soldiers under me. I tell this one, 'Go,' and he goes; and that one, 'Come,' and he comes. I say to my servant, 'Do this,' and he does it.\"\n\nWhen Jesus heard this, he was amazed at him, and turning to the crowd following him, he said, \"I tell you, I have not found such great faith even in Israel.\" Then the men who had been sent returned to the house and found the servant well.\n\nSoon after, Jesus went to a town called Nain, and his disciples and a large crowd went along with him. As he approached the town gate, a dead person was being carried out--the only son of his mother, and she was a widow. A large crowd from the town was with her. When the Lord saw her, his heart went out to her and he said, \"Don't cry.\"\n\nThen he went up and touched the bier they were carrying him on, and the bearers stood still. He said, \"Young man, I say to you, get up!\" The dead man sat up and began to talk, and Jesus gave him back to his mother. They were all filled with awe and praised God. \"A great prophet has appeared among us,\" they said. \"God has come to help his people.\" This news about Jesus spread throughout Judea and the surrounding country.\n\nJohn's disciples told him about all these things. Calling two of them, he sent them to the Lord to ask, \"Are you the one who is to come, or should we expect someone else?\" When the men came to Jesus, they said, \"John the Baptist sent us to you to ask, 'Are you the one who is to come, or should we expect someone else?'\"\n\nAt that very time, Jesus cured many who had diseases, sicknesses, and evil spirits, and gave sight to many who were blind. So he replied to the messengers, \"Go back and report to John what you have seen and heard: The blind receive sight, the lame walk, those who have leprosy are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, and the good news is proclaimed to the poor. Blessed is anyone who does not stumble on account of me.\"\n\nAfter John's messengers left, Jesus began to speak to the crowd about John: \"What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed swayed by the wind? If not, what did you go out to see? A man dressed in fine clothes? No, those who wear expensive clothes and indulge in luxury are in palaces. But what did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, and more than a prophet. This is the one about whom it is written: 'I will send my messenger ahead of you, who will prepare your way before you.' I tell you, among those born of women there is no one greater than John; yet the one who is least in the kingdom of God is greater than he.\"\n\nAll the people, even the tax collectors, when they heard Jesus' words, acknowledged that God's way was right, because they had been baptized by John. But the Pharisees and the experts in the law rejected God's purpose for themselves, because they had not been baptized by John.\n\nJesus went on to say, \"To what, then, can I compare the people of this generation? What are they like? They are like children sitting in the marketplace and calling out to each other: 'We played the pipe for you, and you did not dance; we sang a dirge, and you did not cry.' For John the Baptist came neither eating bread nor drinking wine, and you say, 'He has a demon.' The Son of Man came eating and drinking, and you say, 'Here is a glutton and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners.' But wisdom is proved right by all her children.\"\n\nOne of the Pharisees invited Jesus to have dinner with him, so he went to the Pharisee's house and reclined at the table. A woman in that town who lived a sinful life learned that Jesus was eating at the Pharisee's house, so she came there with an alabaster jar of perfume. As she stood behind him at his feet weeping, she began to wet his feet with her tears. Then she wiped them with her hair, kissed them, and poured perfume on them.\n\nWhen the Pharisee who had invited him saw this, he said to himself, \"If this man were a prophet, he would know who is touching him and what kind of woman she is--that she is a sinner.\"\n\nJesus answered him, \"Simon, I have something to tell you.\"\n\n\"Tell me, teacher,\" he said.\n\n\"Two people owed money to a certain moneylender. One owed him five hundred denarii, and the other fifty. Neither of them had the money to pay him back, so he forgave the debts of both. Now which of them will love him more?\"\n\nSimon replied, \"I suppose the one who had the bigger debt forgiven.\"\n\n\"You have judged correctly,\" Jesus said.\n\nThen he turned toward the woman and said to Simon, \"Do you see this woman? I came into your house. You did not give me any water for my feet, but she wet my feet with her tears and wiped them with her hair. You did not give me a kiss, but this woman, from the time I entered, has not stopped kissing my feet. You did not put oil on my head, but she has poured perfume on my feet. Therefore, I tell you, her many sins have been forgiven--as her great love has shown. But whoever has been forgiven little loves little.\"\n\nThen Jesus said to her, \"Your sins are forgiven.\"\n\nThe other guests began to say among themselves, \"Who is this who even forgives sins?\"\n\nJesus said to the woman, \"Your faith has saved you; go in peace.\""}], "temperature": 0, "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"name": "schema", "schema": {"properties": {"translation": {"type": "string"}}, "required": ["translation"], "type": "object"}}}}}

The twelve disciples were with him, along with some women who had been healed of evil spirits and illnesses. Among them was Mary Magdalene, from whom seven demons had been cast out, Joanna, the wife of Herod's steward Chuza, Susanna, and many others who supported them with their resources.\n\nA large crowd gathered, and people from different towns came to see him. Jesus told them a parable: \"A farmer went out to sow his seed. As he was scattering the seed, some fell along the path, where it was trampled on, and the birds ate it up. Some fell on rocky ground, and when it came up, the plants withered because they had no moisture. Other seed fell among thorns, which grew up with it and choked the plants. Still other seed fell on good soil. It came up and yielded a crop, a hundred times more than was sown.\"\n\nAfter telling the parable, Jesus said, \"Whoever has ears to hear, let them hear.\" His disciples asked him what the parable meant. He replied, \"The knowledge of the secrets of the kingdom of God has been given to you, but to others I speak in parables, so that, 'though seeing, they may not see; though hearing, they may not understand.'\n\n\"This is the meaning of the parable: The seed is the word of God. Those along the path are the ones who hear, and then the devil comes and takes away the word from their hearts, so that they may not believe and be saved. Those on the rocky ground are the ones who receive the word with joy when they hear it, but they have no root. They believe for a while, but in the time of testing, they fall away. The seed that fell among thorns stands for those who hear, but as they go on their way, they are choked by life's worries, riches, and pleasures, and they do not mature. But the seed on good soil stands for those with a noble and good heart, who hear the word, retain it, and by persevering produce a crop.\n\n\"No one lights a lamp and hides it in a jar or puts it under a bed. Instead, they put it on a stand, so that those who come in can see the light. For there is nothing hidden that will not be disclosed, and nothing concealed that will not be known or brought out into the open. Therefore consider carefully how you listen. Whoever has will be given more; whoever does not have, even what they think they have will be taken from them.\"\n\nJesus' mother and brothers came to see him, but they could not get near him because of the crowd. Someone told him, \"Your mother and brothers are standing outside, wanting to see you.\" He replied, \"My mother and brothers are those who hear God's word and put it into practice.\"\n\nOne day, Jesus got into a boat with his disciples and said, \"Let's go over to the other side of the lake.\" As they sailed, he fell asleep. A storm came down on the lake, so that the boat was being swamped, and they were in great danger. The disciples went and woke him, saying, \"Master, Master, we're going to drown!\" He got up and rebuked the wind and the raging waters; the storm subsided, and all was calm. \"Where is your faith?\" he asked his disciples. In fear and amazement, they asked one another, \"Who is this? He commands even the winds and the water, and they obey him.\"\n\nThey sailed to the region of the Gerasenes, which is across the lake from Galilee. When Jesus stepped ashore, he was met by a demon-possessed man from the town. For a long time, this man had not worn clothes or lived in a house, but had lived in the tombs. When he saw Jesus, he cried out and fell at his feet, shouting at the top of his voice, \"What do you want with me, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I beg you, don't torture me!\" For Jesus had commanded the impure spirit to come out of the man. Many times it had seized him, and though he was chained hand and foot and kept under guard, he had broken his chains and had been driven by the demon into solitary places.\n\nJesus asked him, \"What is your name?\" \"Legion,\" he replied, because many demons had gone into him. And they begged Jesus repeatedly not to order them to go into the Abyss.\n\nA large herd of pigs was feeding there on the hillside. The demons begged Jesus to let them go into the pigs, and he gave them permission. When the demons came out of the man, they went into the pigs, and the herd rushed down the steep bank into the lake and was drowned.\n\nWhen those tending the pigs saw what had happened, they ran off and reported this in the town and countryside, and the people went out to see what had happened. When they came to Jesus, they found the man from whom the demons had gone out, sitting at Jesus' feet, dressed and in his right mind; and they were afraid. Those who had seen it told the people how the demon-possessed man had been cured.\n\nThen all the people of the region of the Gerasenes asked Jesus to leave them, because they were overcome with fear. So he got into the boat and left. The man from whom the demons had gone out begged to go with him, but Jesus sent him away, saying, \"Return home and tell how much God has done for you.\" So the man went away and told all over town how much Jesus had done for him.\n\nWhen Jesus returned, a crowd welcomed him, for they were all expecting him. Then a man named Jairus, a synagogue leader, came and fell at Jesus' feet, pleading with him to come to his house because his only daughter, a girl of about twelve, was dying. As Jesus was on his way, the crowds almost crushed him.\n\nAnd a woman was there who had been subject to bleeding for twelve years, but no one could heal her. She came up behind him and touched the edge of his cloak, and immediately her bleeding stopped. \"Who touched me?\" Jesus asked. When they all denied it, Peter said, \"Master, the people are crowding and pressing against you.\" But Jesus said, \"Someone touched me; I know that power has gone out from me.\"\n\nThen the woman, seeing that she could not go unnoticed, came trembling and fell at his feet. In the presence of all the people, she told why she had touched him and how she had been instantly healed. Then he said to her, \"Daughter, your faith has healed you. Go in peace.\"\n\nWhile Jesus was still speaking, someone came from the house of Jairus, the synagogue leader. \"Your daughter is dead,\" he said. \"Don't bother the teacher anymore.\" Hearing this, Jesus said to Jairus, \"Don't be afraid; just believe, and she will be healed.\"\n\nWhen he arrived at the house of Jairus, he did not let anyone go in with him except Peter, John, and James, and the child's father and mother. Meanwhile, all the people were wailing and mourning for her. \"Stop wailing,\" Jesus said. \"She is not dead but asleep.\" They laughed at him, knowing that she was dead. But he took her by the hand and said, \"My child, get up!\" Her spirit returned, and at once she stood up. Then Jesus told them to give her something to eat. Her parents were astonished, but he ordered them not to tell anyone what had happened."}], "temperature": 0, "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"name": "schema", "schema": {"properties": {"translation": {"type": "string"}}, "required": ["translation"], "type": "object"}}}}}

He sent them out to proclaim the kingdom of God and to heal the sick. He told them, \"Take nothing for the journey--no staff, no bag, no bread, no money, no extra shirt. Whatever house you enter, stay there until you leave that town. If people do not welcome you, leave their town and shake the dust off your feet as a testimony against them.\" So they set out and went from village to village, proclaiming the good news and healing people everywhere.\n\nHerod the tetrarch heard about all that was happening, and he was perplexed because some were saying that John had been raised from the dead, others that Elijah had appeared, and still others that one of the prophets of long ago had come back to life. But Herod said, \"I beheaded John. Who, then, is this I hear such things about?\" And he tried to see him.\n\nWhen the apostles returned, they reported to Jesus what they had done. Then he took them with him and they withdrew by themselves to a town called Bethsaida, but the crowds learned about it and followed him. He welcomed them and spoke to them about the kingdom of God, and healed those who needed healing.\n\nLate in the afternoon, the Twelve came to him and said, \"Send the crowd away so they can go to the surrounding villages and countryside and find food and lodging, because we are in a remote place here.\" He replied, \"You give them something to eat.\" They answered, \"We have only five loaves of bread and two fish--unless we go and buy food for all this crowd.\" (About five thousand men were there.) But he said to his disciples, \"Have them sit down in groups of about fifty each.\" The disciples did so, and everyone sat down. Taking the five loaves and the two fish and looking up to heaven, he gave thanks and broke them. Then he gave them to the disciples to distribute to the people. They all ate and were satisfied, and the disciples picked up twelve basketfuls of broken pieces that were left over.\n\nOnce when Jesus was praying in private and his disciples were with him, he asked them, \"Who do the crowds say I am?\" They replied, \"Some say John the Baptist; others say Elijah; and still others, that one of the prophets of long ago has come back to life.\" \"But what about you?\" he asked. \"Who do you say I am?\" Peter answered, \"God's Messiah.\"\n\nJesus strictly warned them not to tell this to anyone. And he said, \"The Son of Man must suffer many things and be rejected by the elders, the chief priests and the teachers of the law, and he must be killed and on the third day be raised to life.\" Then he said to them all: \"Whoever wants to be my disciple must deny themselves and take up their cross daily and follow me. For whoever wants to save their life will lose it, but whoever loses their life for me will save it. What good is it for someone to gain the whole world, and yet lose or forfeit their very self? Whoever is ashamed of me and my words, the Son of Man will be ashamed of them when he comes in his glory and in the glory of the Father and of the holy angels. Truly I tell you, some who are standing here will not taste death before they see the kingdom of God.\"\n\nAbout eight days after Jesus said this, he took Peter, John and James with him and went up onto a mountain to pray. As he was praying, the appearance of his face changed, and his clothes became as bright as a flash of lightning. Two men, Moses and Elijah, appeared in glorious splendor, talking with Jesus. They spoke about his departure, which he was about to bring to fulfillment at Jerusalem. Peter and his companions were very sleepy, but when they became fully awake, they saw his glory and the two men standing with him. As the men were leaving Jesus, Peter said to him, \"Master, it is good for us to be here. Let us put up three shelters--one for you, one for Moses and one for Elijah.\" (He did not know what he was saying.) While he was speaking, a cloud appeared and covered them, and they were afraid as they entered the cloud. A voice came from the cloud, saying, \"This is my Son, whom I have chosen; listen to him.\" When the voice had spoken, they found that Jesus was alone. The disciples kept this to themselves and did not tell anyone at that time what they had seen.\n\nThe next day, when they came down from the mountain, a large crowd met him. A man in the crowd called out, \"Teacher, I beg you to look at my son, for he is my only child. A spirit seizes him and he suddenly screams; it throws him into convulsions so that he foams at the mouth. It scarcely ever leaves him and is destroying him. I begged your disciples to drive it out, but they could not.\" \"You unbelieving and perverse generation,\" Jesus replied, \"how long shall I stay with you and put up with you? Bring your son here.\" Even while the boy was coming, the demon threw him to the ground in a convulsion. But Jesus rebuked the impure spirit, healed the boy and gave him back to his father. And they were all amazed at the greatness of God.\n\nWhile everyone was marveling at all that Jesus did, he said to his disciples, \"Listen carefully to what I am about to tell you: The Son of Man is going to be delivered into the hands of men.\" But they did not understand what this meant. It was hidden from them, so that they did not grasp it, and they were afraid to ask him about it.\n\nAn argument started among the disciples as to which of them would be the greatest. Jesus, knowing their thoughts, took a little child and had him stand beside him. Then he said to them, \"Whoever welcomes this little child in my name welcomes me; and whoever welcomes me welcomes the one who sent me. For it is the one who is least among you all who is the greatest.\"\n\n\"Master,\" said John, \"we saw someone driving out demons in your name and we tried to stop him, because he is not one of us.\" \"Do not stop him,\" Jesus said, \"for whoever is not against you is for you.\"\n\nAs the time approached for him to be taken up to heaven, Jesus resolutely set out for Jerusalem. And he sent messengers on ahead, who went into a Samaritan village to get things ready for him; but the people there did not welcome him, because he was heading for Jerusalem. When the disciples James and John saw this, they asked, \"Lord, do you want us to call fire down from heaven to destroy them?\" But Jesus turned and rebuked them. Then he and his disciples went to another village.\n\nAs they were walking along the road, a man said to him, \"I will follow you wherever you go.\" Jesus replied, \"Foxes have dens and birds have nests, but the Son of Man has no place to lay his head.\" He said to another man, \"Follow me.\" But he replied, \"Lord, first let me go and bury my father.\" Jesus said to him, \"Let the dead bury their own dead, but you go and proclaim the kingdom of God.\" Still another said, \"I will follow you, Lord; but first let me go back and say goodbye to my family.\" Jesus replied, \"No one who puts a hand to the plow and looks back is fit for service in the kingdom of God.\""}], "temperature": 0, "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"name": "schema", "schema": {"properties": {"translation": {"type": "string"}}, "required": ["translation"], "type": "object"}}}}}

He told them, \"The harvest is plentiful, but the workers are few. Ask the Lord of the harvest to send out workers into his harvest field. Go! I am sending you out like lambs among wolves. Do not take a purse or bag or sandals, and do not greet anyone on the road. When you enter a house, first say, 'Peace to this house.' If someone who promotes peace is there, your peace will rest on them; if not, it will return to you. Stay there, eating and drinking whatever they give you, for the worker deserves his wages. Do not move around from house to house. When you enter a town and are welcomed, eat what is offered to you. Heal the sick who are there and tell them, 'The kingdom of God has come near to you.' But when you enter a town and are not welcomed, go into its streets and say, 'Even the dust of your town we wipe from our feet as a warning to you. Yet be sure of this: The kingdom of God has come near.' I tell you, it will be more bearable on that day for Sodom than for that town. Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the miracles that were performed in you had been performed in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago, sitting in sackcloth and ashes. But it will be more bearable for Tyre and Sidon at the judgment than for you. And you, Capernaum, will you be lifted to the heavens? No, you will go down to Hades. Whoever listens to you listens to me; whoever rejects you rejects me; but whoever rejects me rejects him who sent me.\"\n\nThe seventy-two returned with joy and said, \"Lord, even the demons submit to us in your name.\" He replied, \"I saw Satan fall like lightning from heaven. I have given you authority to trample on snakes and scorpions and to overcome all the power of the enemy; nothing will harm you. However, do not rejoice that the spirits submit to you, but rejoice that your names are written in heaven.\"\n\nAt that time Jesus, full of joy through the Holy Spirit, said, \"I praise you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because you have hidden these things from the wise and learned, and revealed them to little children. Yes, Father, for this is what you were pleased to do. All things have been committed to me by my Father. No one knows who the Son is except the Father, and no one knows who the Father is except the Son and those to whom the Son chooses to reveal him.\"\n\nThen he turned to his disciples and said privately, \"Blessed are the eyes that see what you see. For I tell you that many prophets and kings wanted to see what you see but did not see it, and to hear what you hear but did not hear it.\"\n\nOn one occasion an expert in the law stood up to test Jesus. \"Teacher,\" he asked, \"what must I do to inherit eternal life?\" \"What is written in the Law?\" he replied. \"How do you read it?\" He answered, \"'Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength and with all your mind'; and, 'Love your neighbor as yourself.'\" \"You have answered correctly,\" Jesus replied. \"Do this and you will live.\"\n\nBut he wanted to justify himself, so he asked Jesus, \"And who is my neighbor?\" In reply Jesus said: \"A man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho, when he was attacked by robbers. They stripped him of his clothes, beat him and went away, leaving him half dead. A priest happened to be going down the same road, and when he saw the man, he passed by on the other side. So too, a Levite, when he came to the place and saw him, passed by on the other side. But a Samaritan, as he traveled, came where the man was; and when he saw him, he took pity on him. He went to him and bandaged his wounds, pouring on oil and wine. Then he put the man on his own donkey, brought him to an inn and took care of him. The next day he took out two denarii and gave them to the innkeeper. 'Look after him,' he said, 'and when I return, I will reimburse you for any extra expense you may have.'\n\n\"Which of these three do you think was a neighbor to the man who fell into the hands of robbers?\" The expert in the law replied, \"The one who had mercy on him.\" Jesus told him, \"Go and do likewise.\"\n\nAs Jesus and his disciples were on their way, he came to a village where a woman named Martha opened her home to him. She had a sister called Mary, who sat at the Lord's feet listening to what he said. But Martha was distracted by all the preparations that had to be made. She came to him and asked, \"Lord, don't you care that my sister has left me to do the work by myself? Tell her to help me!\"\n\n\"Martha, Martha,\" the Lord answered, \"you are worried and upset about many things, but few things are needed--or indeed only one.

May your kingdom come. Give us each day the food we need. Forgive us our sins, as we forgive those who sin against us. And don't let us fall into temptation.'\"\n\nThen Jesus told them a story: \"Suppose one of you has a friend, and you go to him at midnight and say, 'Friend, lend me three loaves of bread, because a friend of mine has come to visit, and I have nothing to offer him.' And suppose the friend answers from inside, 'Don't bother me. The door is already locked, and my children and I are in bed. I can't get up and give you anything.' I tell you, even if he won't get up and give you the bread because of friendship, he will get up and give you whatever you need because of your persistence.\n\nSo I say to you: Ask, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock, and the door will be opened to you. For everyone who asks receives; the one who seeks finds; and to the one who knocks, the door will be opened.\n\nWhich of you fathers, if your son asks for a fish, will give him a snake instead? Or if he asks for an egg, will give him a scorpion? If you, then, who are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father in heaven give the Holy Spirit to those who ask him!\"\n\nJesus was driving out a demon that was mute. When the demon left, the man who had been mute spoke, and the crowd was amazed. But some of them said, \"By Beelzebul, the prince of demons, he is driving out demons.\" Others tested him by asking for a sign from heaven.\n\nJesus knew their thoughts and said to them, \"Any kingdom divided against itself will be ruined, and a house divided against itself will fall. If Satan is divided against himself, how can his kingdom stand? I say this because you claim that I drive out demons by Beelzebul. Now if I drive out demons by Beelzebul, by whom do your followers drive them out? So then, they will be your judges. But if I drive out demons by the finger of God, then the kingdom of God has come upon you.\n\nWhen a strong man, fully armed, guards his own house, his possessions are safe. But when someone stronger attacks and overpowers him, he takes away the armor in which the man trusted and divides up his plunder.\n\nWhoever is not with me is against me, and whoever does not gather with me scatters.\n\nWhen an impure spirit comes out of a person, it goes through arid places seeking rest and does not find it. Then it says, 'I will return to the house I left.' When it arrives, it finds the house swept clean and put in order. Then it goes and takes seven other spirits more wicked than itself, and they go in and live there. And the final condition of that person is worse than the first.\"\n\nAs Jesus was saying these things, a woman in the crowd called out, \"Blessed is the mother who gave you birth and nursed you.\" He replied, \"Blessed rather are those who hear the word of God and obey it.\"\n\nAs the crowds increased, Jesus said, \"This is a wicked generation. It asks for a sign, but none will be given it except the sign of Jonah. For as Jonah was a sign to the Ninevites, so also will the Son of Man be to this generation.\n\nThe Queen of the South will rise at the judgment with the people of this generation and condemn them; for she came from the ends of the earth to listen to Solomon's wisdom, and now something greater than Solomon is here.\n\nThe people of Nineveh will stand up at the judgment with this generation and condemn it; for they repented at the preaching of Jonah, and now something greater than Jonah is here.\n\nNo one lights a lamp and puts it in a place where it will be hidden, or under a bowl. Instead, they put it on its stand, so that those who come in may see the light.\n\nYour eye is the lamp of your body. When your eyes are healthy, your whole body also is full of light. But when they are unhealthy, your body also is full of darkness. See to it, then, that the light within you is not darkness. Therefore, if your whole body is full of light, and no part of it dark, it will be just as full of light as when a lamp shines its light on you.\"\n\nWhen Jesus had finished speaking, a Pharisee invited him to eat with him; so he went in and reclined at the table. But the Pharisee was surprised when he noticed that Jesus did not first wash before the meal.\n\nThen the Lord said to him, \"Now then, you Pharisees clean the outside of the cup and dish, but inside you are full of greed and wickedness. You foolish people! Did not the one who made the outside make the inside also? But now as for what is inside you--be generous to the poor, and everything will be clean for you.\n\nWoe to you Pharisees, because you give God a tenth of your mint, rue and all other kinds of garden herbs, but you neglect justice and the love of God. You should have practiced the latter without leaving the former undone.\n\nWoe to you Pharisees, because you love the most important seats in the synagogues and respectful greetings in the marketplaces.\n\nWoe to you, because you are like unmarked graves, which people walk over without knowing it.\"\n\nOne of the experts in the law answered him, \"Teacher, when you say these things, you insult us also.\" Jesus replied, \"And you experts in the law, woe to you, because you load people down with burdens they can hardly carry, and you yourselves will not lift one finger to help them.\n\nWoe to you, because you build tombs for the prophets, and it was your ancestors who killed them. So you testify that you approve of what your ancestors did; they killed the prophets, and you build their tombs.\n\nBecause of this, God in his wisdom said, 'I will send them prophets and apostles, some of whom they will kill and others they will persecute.' Therefore this generation will be held responsible for the blood of all the prophets that has been shed since the beginning of the world, from the blood of Abel to the blood of Zechariah, who was killed between the altar and the sanctuary. Yes, I tell you, this generation will be held responsible for it all.\n\nWoe to you experts in the law, because you have taken away the key to knowledge. You yourselves have not entered, and you have hindered those who were entering.\"\n\nWhen Jesus went outside, the Pharisees and the teachers of the law began to oppose him fiercely and to besiege him with questions, waiting to catch him in something he might say."}], "temperature": 0, "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"name": "schema", "schema": {"properties": {"translation": {"type": "string"}}, "required": ["translation"], "type": "object"}}}}}

He told them not to fear those who can kill the body but can't do anything more. Instead, they should fear God, who has the power to throw them into hell after death.\n\nJesus reassured them that God cares for them more than sparrows, and even the hairs on their heads are counted. He encouraged them to acknowledge him before others, and he would acknowledge them before God's angels. But those who deny him will be denied before the angels.\n\nHe also said that anyone who speaks against him will be forgiven, but blaspheming against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven. When they are brought before authorities, they shouldn't worry about what to say because the Holy Spirit will teach them what to say at that moment.\n\nSomeone in the crowd asked Jesus to tell his brother to share the inheritance with him. Jesus replied that he wasn't appointed as a judge over them. He warned them to be on guard against greed because life isn't about having lots of possessions.\n\nHe told a parable about a rich man whose land produced a lot. The man decided to tear down his barns and build bigger ones to store all his grain and goods. He thought he could relax and enjoy life, but God told him that he would die that night, and then who would get what he had prepared?\n\nJesus told his disciples not to worry about their lives, what they would eat, or what they would wear. Life is more than food, and the body is more than clothes. He pointed out that God feeds the ravens and clothes the lilies, so they shouldn't worry because they are more valuable than birds.\n\nHe encouraged them to seek God's kingdom, and everything else would be given to them. He told them to sell their possessions and give to the poor, storing up treasure in heaven where it can't be stolen or destroyed.\n\nHe advised them to be ready and watchful, like servants waiting for their master to return from a wedding banquet.

Or those eighteen who died when the tower in Siloam fell on them--do you think they were more guilty than all the others living in Jerusalem? I tell you, no! But unless you repent, you too will all perish.\"\n\nThen he told this parable: \"A man had a fig tree growing in his vineyard, and he went to look for fruit on it but did not find any. So he said to the man who took care of the vineyard, 'For three years now I've been coming to look for fruit on this fig tree and haven't found any. Cut it down! Why should it use up the soil?' 'Sir,' the man replied, 'leave it alone for one more year, and I'll dig around it and fertilize it. If it bears fruit next year, fine! If not, then cut it down.'\"\n\nOn a Sabbath, Jesus was teaching in one of the synagogues, and a woman was there who had been crippled by a spirit for eighteen years. She was bent over and could not straighten up at all. When Jesus saw her, he called her forward and said to her, \"Woman, you are set free from your infirmity.\" Then he put his hands on her, and immediately she straightened up and praised God.\n\nIndignant because Jesus had healed on the Sabbath, the synagogue leader said to the people, \"There are six days for work. So come and be healed on those days, not on the Sabbath.\" The Lord answered him, \"You hypocrites! Doesn't each of you on the Sabbath untie your ox or donkey from the stall and lead it out to give it water? Then should not this woman, a daughter of Abraham, whom Satan has kept bound for eighteen long years, be set free on the Sabbath day from what bound her?\" When he said this, all his opponents were humiliated, but the people were delighted with all the wonderful things he was doing.\n\nThen Jesus asked, \"What is the kingdom of God like? What shall I compare it to? It is like a mustard seed, which a man took and planted in his garden. It grew and became a tree, and the birds perched in its branches.\" Again he asked, \"What shall I compare the kingdom of God to? It is like yeast that a woman took and mixed into about sixty pounds of flour until it worked all through the dough.\"\n\nThen Jesus went through the towns and villages, teaching as he made his way to Jerusalem. Someone asked him, \"Lord, are only a few people going to be saved?\" He said to them, \"Make every effort to enter through the narrow door, because many, I tell you, will try to enter and will not be able to. Once the owner of the house gets up and closes the door, you will stand outside knocking and pleading, 'Sir, open the door for us.' But he will answer, 'I don't know you or where you come from.' Then you will say, 'We ate and drank with you, and you taught in our streets.' But he will reply, 'I don't know you or where you come from. Away from me, all you evildoers!' There will be weeping there, and gnashing of teeth, when you see Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob and all the prophets in the kingdom of God, but you yourselves thrown out.

He said, \"When you're invited to a wedding, don't sit in the best seat. Someone more important might be invited, and the host will ask you to move, and you'll be embarrassed. Instead, sit in the least important place, so the host might say, 'Friend, move up to a better place.' Then you'll be honored in front of everyone.

You'll be repaid at the resurrection of the righteous.\"\n\nHearing this, one of the guests said, \"Blessed is the one who will eat at the feast in the kingdom of God.\" Jesus replied, \"A man was preparing a great banquet and invited many guests. When it was time for the banquet, he sent his servant to tell those invited, 'Come, everything is ready.' But they all began to make excuses. One said, 'I just bought a field and need to go see it. Please excuse me.' Another said, 'I just bought five pairs of oxen and am on my way to try them out. Please excuse me.' Another said, 'I just got married, so I can't come.'\n\nThe servant returned and reported this to his master. The owner of the house became angry and ordered his servant, 'Go out quickly into the streets and alleys of the town and bring in the poor, the crippled, the blind, and the lame.' The servant said, 'Sir, what you ordered has been done, but there is still room.'

Then you call your friends and neighbors together and say, 'Rejoice with me; I have found my lost sheep.' I tell you that in the same way there will be more joy in heaven over one sinner who repents than over ninety-nine righteous people who do not need to repent.\n\nOr suppose a woman has ten silver coins and loses one. Doesn't she light a lamp, sweep the house, and search carefully until she finds it? And when she finds it, she calls her friends and neighbors together and says, 'Rejoice with me; I have found my lost coin.' In the same way, I tell you, there is rejoicing in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner who repents.\n\nJesus continued: \"There was a man who had two sons. The younger one said to his father, 'Father, give me my share of the estate.' So he divided his property between them. Not long after that, the younger son got together all he had, set off for a distant country, and there squandered his wealth in wild living. After he had spent everything, there was a severe famine in that whole country, and he began to be in need. So he went and hired himself out to a citizen of that country, who sent him to his fields to feed pigs. He longed to fill his stomach with the pods that the pigs were eating, but no one gave him anything.\n\nWhen he came to his senses, he said, 'How many of my father's hired servants have food to spare, and here I am starving to death! I will set out and go back to my father and say to him: Father, I have sinned against heaven and against you. I am no longer worthy to be called your son; make me like one of your hired servants.' So he got up and went to his father.\n\nBut while he was still a long way off, his father saw him and was filled with compassion for him; he ran to his son, threw his arms around him, and kissed him. The son said to him, 'Father, I have sinned against heaven and against you. I am no longer worthy to be called your son.'\n\nBut the father said to his servants, 'Quick! Bring the best robe and put it on him. Put a ring on his finger and sandals on his feet. Bring the fattened calf and kill it. Let's have a feast and celebrate. For this son of mine was dead and is alive again; he was lost and is found.' So they began to celebrate.\n\nMeanwhile, the older son was in the field. When he came near the house, he heard music and dancing. So he called one of the servants and asked him what was going on. 'Your brother has come,' he replied, 'and your father has killed the fattened calf because he has him back safe and sound.'\n\nThe older brother became angry and refused to go in. So his father went out and pleaded with him. But he answered his father, 'Look! All these years I've been slaving for you and never disobeyed your orders. Yet you never gave me even a young goat so I could celebrate with my friends. But when this son of yours who has squandered your property with prostitutes comes home, you kill the fattened calf for him!'\n\n'\"My son,' the father said, 'you are always with me, and everything I have is yours.

I'm not strong enough to dig, and I'm ashamed to beg. I know what I'll do so that, when I lose my job here, people will welcome me into their houses.\" So he called in each one of his master's debtors. He asked the first, \"How much do you owe my master?\" \"Nine hundred gallons of olive oil,\" he replied. The manager told him, \"Take your bill, sit down quickly, and make it four hundred and fifty.\" Then he asked the second, \"And how much do you owe?\" \"A thousand bushels of wheat,\" he replied. He told him, \"Take your bill and make it eight hundred.\" The master commended the dishonest manager because he had acted shrewdly. For the people of this world are more shrewd in dealing with their own kind than are the people of the light. I tell you, use worldly wealth to gain friends for yourselves, so that when it is gone, you will be welcomed into eternal dwellings.

Either you will hate the one and love the other, or you will be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve both God and money. The Pharisees, who loved money, heard all this and were sneering at Jesus. He said to them, \"You are the ones who justify yourselves in the eyes of others, but God knows your hearts.

Since that time, the good news of the kingdom of God is being preached, and everyone is forcing their way into it. It is easier for heaven and earth to disappear than for the least stroke of a pen to drop out of the Law. Anyone who divorces his wife and marries another woman commits adultery, and the man who marries a divorced woman commits adultery. There was a rich man who was dressed in purple and fine linen and lived in luxury every day. At his gate was laid a beggar named Lazarus, covered with sores and longing to eat what fell from the rich man's table. Even the dogs came and licked his sores. The time came when the beggar died and the angels carried him to Abraham's side. The rich man also died and was buried. In Hades, where he was in torment, he looked up and saw Abraham far away, with Lazarus by his side. So he called to him, \"Father Abraham, have pity on me and send Lazarus to dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue, because I am in agony in this fire.\" But Abraham replied, \"Son, remember that in your lifetime you received your good things, while Lazarus received bad things, but now he is comforted here and you are in agony. And besides all this, between us and you a great chasm has been set in place, so that those who want to go from here to you cannot, nor can anyone cross over from there to us.\" He answered, \"Then I beg you, father, send Lazarus to my family, for I have five brothers. Let him warn them, so that they will not also come to this place of torment.\" Abraham replied, \"They have Moses and the Prophets; let them listen to them.\" \"No, father Abraham,\" he said, \"but if someone from the dead goes to them, they will repent.\" He said to him, \"If they do not listen to Moses and the Prophets, they will not be convinced even if someone rises from the dead.\""}], "temperature": 0, "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"name": "schema", "schema": {"properties": {"translation": {"type": "string"}}, "required": ["translation"], "type": "object"}}}}}

If your brother sins, correct him, and if he repents, forgive him. Even if he sins against you seven times in a day and comes back to you saying, 'I repent,' forgive him.\"\n\nThe apostles said to the Lord, \"Increase our faith!\" Jesus replied, \"If you have faith as small as a mustard seed, you can say to this mulberry tree, 'Be uprooted and planted in the sea,' and it will obey you.\n\n\"Suppose one of you has a servant plowing or looking after the sheep. Will you say to the servant when he comes in from the field, 'Come along now and sit down to eat'? Won't you rather say, 'Prepare my supper, get yourself ready and wait on me while I eat and drink; after that you may eat and drink'? Will he thank the servant because he did what he was told to do? So you also, when you have done everything you were told to do, should say, 'We are unworthy servants; we have only done our duty.'\"\n\nAs Jesus was on his way to Jerusalem, he traveled along the border between Samaria and Galilee. As he was going into a village, ten men who had leprosy met him. They stood at a distance and called out in a loud voice, \"Jesus, Master, have pity on us!\" When he saw them, he said, \"Go, show yourselves to the priests.\" And as they went, they were cleansed.\n\nOne of them, when he saw he was healed, came back, praising God in a loud voice. He threw himself at Jesus' feet and thanked him--and he was a Samaritan. Jesus asked, \"Were not all ten cleansed? Where are the other nine? Has no one returned to give praise to God except this foreigner?\" Then he said to him, \"Rise and go; your faith has made you well.\"\n\nOnce, having been asked by the Pharisees when the kingdom of God would come, Jesus replied, \"The coming of the kingdom of God is not something that can be observed, nor will people say, 'Here it is,' or 'There it is,' because the kingdom of God is in your midst.\"\n\nThen he said to his disciples, \"The time is coming when you will long to see one of the days of the Son of Man, but you will not see it. People will tell you, 'There he is!' or 'Here he is!' Do not go running off after them. For the Son of Man in his day will be like the lightning, which flashes and lights up the sky from one end to the other. But first he must suffer many things and be rejected by this generation.\n\n\"Just as it was in the days of Noah, so also will it be in the days of the Son of Man. People were eating, drinking, marrying and being given in marriage up to the day Noah entered the ark. Then the flood came and destroyed them all.\n\n\"It was the same in the days of Lot. People were eating and drinking, buying and selling, planting and building. But the day Lot left Sodom, fire and sulfur rained down from heaven and destroyed them all.\n\n\"It will be just like this on the day the Son of Man is revealed. On that day no one who is on the housetop, with possessions inside, should go down to get them. Likewise, no one in the field should go back for anything. Remember Lot's wife! Whoever tries to keep their life will lose it, and whoever loses their life will preserve it.\n\n\"I tell you, on that night two people will be in one bed; one will be taken and the other left. Two women will be grinding grain together; one will be taken and the other left.\"\n\n\"Where, Lord?\" they asked.\n\nHe replied, \"Where there is a dead body, there the vultures will gather.\""}], "temperature": 0, "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"name": "schema", "schema": {"properties": {"translation": {"type": "string"}}, "required": ["translation"], "type": "object"}}}}}

He said there was a judge in a city who didn't fear God or care about people. A widow in that city kept coming to him, asking for justice against her enemy. For a while, he refused, but later he thought, \"Even though I don't fear God or care about people, I'll give her justice so she won't keep bothering me.\" Jesus said, \"Listen to what the unjust judge says. Won't God bring justice for His chosen ones who cry out to Him day and night? He will see that they get justice quickly. But when the Son of Man comes, will He find faith on the earth?\"\n\nJesus also told this story to some who were confident in their own righteousness and looked down on others. Two men went to the temple to pray, one a Pharisee and the other a tax collector. The Pharisee stood by himself and prayed, \"God, I thank you that I am not like other people--robbers, evildoers, adulterers--or even like this tax collector. I fast twice a week and give a tenth of all I get.\" But the tax collector stood at a distance. He wouldn't even look up to heaven, but beat his chest and said, \"God, have mercy on me, a sinner.\" Jesus said, \"I tell you that this man, rather than the other, went home justified before God. For all those who exalt themselves will be humbled, and those who humble themselves will be exalted.\"\n\nPeople were also bringing babies to Jesus for Him to place His hands on them. When the disciples saw this, they rebuked them. But Jesus called the children to Him and said, \"Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of God belongs to such as these. Truly I tell you, anyone who will not receive the kingdom of God like a little child will never enter it.\"\n\nA certain ruler asked Him, \"Good teacher, what must I do to inherit eternal life?\" Jesus replied, \"Why do you call me good? No one is good--except God alone. You know the commandments: 'You shall not commit adultery, you shall not murder, you shall not steal, you shall not give false testimony, honor your father and mother.'\" \"All these I have kept since I was a boy,\" he said. When Jesus heard this, He said to him, \"You still lack one thing. Sell everything you have and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come, follow me.\" When he heard this, he became very sad, because he was very wealthy. Jesus looked at him and said, \"How hard it is for the rich to enter the kingdom of God! Indeed, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of God.\" Those who heard this asked, \"Who then can be saved?\" Jesus replied, \"What is impossible with man is possible with God.\"\n\nPeter said to Him, \"We have left all we had to follow you!\" \"Truly I tell you,\" Jesus said to them, \"no one who has left home or wife or brothers or sisters or parents or children for the sake of the kingdom of God will fail to receive many times as much in this age, and in the age to come eternal life.\"\n\nJesus took the Twelve aside and told them, \"We are going up to Jerusalem, and everything that is written by the prophets about the Son of Man will be fulfilled. He will be delivered over to the Gentiles. They will mock him, insult him, and spit on him; they will flog him and kill him. On the third day, he will rise again.\" The disciples did not understand any of this. Its meaning was hidden from them, and they did not know what He was talking about.\n\nAs Jesus approached Jericho, a blind man was sitting by the roadside begging. When he heard the crowd going by, he asked what was happening. They told him, \"Jesus of Nazareth is passing by.\" He called out, \"Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!\" Those who led the way rebuked him and told him to be quiet, but he shouted all the more, \"Son of David, have mercy on me!\" Jesus stopped and ordered the man to be brought to Him. When he came near, Jesus asked him, \"What do you want me to do for you?\" \"Lord, I want to see,\" he replied. Jesus said to him, \"Receive your sight; your faith has healed you.\" Immediately he received his sight and followed Jesus, praising God.

He wanted to see who Jesus was, but he couldn't because of the crowd, as he was short. So he ran ahead and climbed a sycamore tree to see Jesus, who was going to pass that way. When Jesus reached the spot, he looked up and said, \"Zacchaeus, come down quickly, for I must stay at your house today.\" Zacchaeus came down at once and welcomed him gladly. All the people saw this and began to mutter, \"He has gone to be the guest of a sinner.\" But Zacchaeus stood up and said to the Lord, \"Look, Lord! Here and now I give half of my possessions to the poor, and if I have cheated anybody out of anything, I will pay back four times the amount.\" Jesus said to him, \"Today salvation has come to this house, because this man, too, is a son of Abraham. For the Son of Man came to seek and to save the lost.\"\n\nWhile they were listening to this, Jesus went on to tell them a parable, because he was near Jerusalem and the people thought that the kingdom of God was going to appear at once. He said, \"A man of noble birth went to a distant country to have himself appointed king and then to return. So he called ten of his servants and gave them ten minas. 'Put this money to work,' he said, 'until I come back.' But his subjects hated him and sent a delegation after him to say, 'We don't want this man to be our king.'\n\n\"He was made king, however, and returned home. Then he sent for the servants to whom he had given the money, in order to find out what they had gained with it. The first one came and said, 'Sir, your mina has earned ten more.'\n\n\"'Well done, my good servant!' his master replied. 'Because you have been trustworthy in a very small matter, take charge of ten cities.'\n\n\"The second came and said, 'Sir, your mina has earned five more.'\n\n\"His master answered, 'You take charge of five cities.'\n\n\"Then another servant came and said, 'Sir, here is your mina; I have kept it laid away in a piece of cloth. I was afraid of you, because you are a hard man. You take out what you did not put in and reap what you did not sow.'\n\n\"His master replied, 'I will judge you by your own words, you wicked servant! You knew, did you, that I am a hard man, taking out what I did not put in and reaping what I did not sow? Why then didn't you put my money on deposit, so that when I came back, I could have collected it with interest?'\n\n\"Then he said to those standing by, 'Take his mina away from him and give it to the one who has ten minas.'\n\n\"'Sir,' they said, 'he already has ten!'\n\n\"He replied, 'I tell you that to everyone who has, more will be given, but as for the one who has nothing, even what they have will be taken away. But those enemies of mine who did not want me to be king over them--bring them here and kill them in front of me.'\"\n\nAfter Jesus had said this, he went on ahead, going up to Jerusalem. As he approached Bethphage and Bethany at the hill called the Mount of Olives, he sent two of his disciples, saying to them, \"Go to the village ahead of you, and as you enter it, you will find a colt tied there, which no one has ever ridden. Untie it and bring it here. If anyone asks you, 'Why are you untying it?' say, 'The Lord needs it.'\"\n\nThose who were sent ahead went and found it just as he had told them. As they were untying the colt, its owners asked them, \"Why are you untying the colt?\"\n\nThey replied, \"The Lord needs it.\"\n\nThey brought it to Jesus, threw their cloaks on the colt, and put Jesus on it. As he went along, people spread their cloaks on the road. When he came near the place where the road goes down the Mount of Olives, the whole crowd of disciples began joyfully to praise God in loud voices for all the miracles they had seen:\n\n\"Blessed is the king who comes in the name of the Lord! Peace in heaven and glory in the highest!\"\n\nSome of the Pharisees in the crowd said to Jesus, \"Teacher, rebuke your disciples!\"\n\n\"I tell you,\" he replied, \"if they keep quiet, the stones will cry out.\"\n\nAs he approached Jerusalem and saw the city, he wept over it and said, \"If you, even you, had only known on this day what would bring you peace--but now it is hidden from your eyes. The days will come upon you when your enemies will build an embankment against you and encircle you and hem you in on every side. They will dash you to the ground, you and the children within your walls. They will not leave one stone on another, because you did not recognize the time of God's coming to you.\"\n\nWhen Jesus entered the temple courts, he began to drive out those who were selling. \"It is written,\" he said to them, \"'My house will be a house of prayer'; but you have made it 'a den of robbers.'\"\n\nEvery day he was teaching at the temple. But the chief priests, the teachers of the law and the leaders among the people were trying to kill him.

Tell me, was the baptism of John from heaven or from men?\" They discussed it among themselves, saying, \"If we say, 'From heaven,' he will ask, 'Why didn't you believe him?' But if we say, 'From men,' all the people will stone us, for they are convinced that John was a prophet.\" So they answered that they did not know where it was from. Jesus said to them, \"Neither will I tell you by what authority I do these things.\"\n\nThen he began to tell the people this parable: \"A man planted a vineyard, rented it to some farmers, and went away for a long time. At harvest time, he sent a servant to the tenants so they would give him some of the fruit of the vineyard. But the tenants beat him and sent him away empty-handed. He sent another servant, but they also beat and humiliated him and sent him away empty-handed. He sent a third, and they wounded him and threw him out. Then the owner of the vineyard said, 'What shall I do? I will send my beloved son; perhaps they will respect him.' But when the tenants saw him, they discussed among themselves, 'This is the heir. Let's kill him so the inheritance will be ours.' So they threw him out of the vineyard and killed him. What then will the owner of the vineyard do to them? He will come and destroy those tenants and give the vineyard to others.\" When the people heard this, they said, \"May this never happen!\"\n\nJesus looked directly at them and asked, \"Then what is the meaning of that which is written: 'The stone the builders rejected has become the cornerstone'? Everyone who falls on that stone will be broken to pieces, but anyone on whom it falls will be crushed.\" The teachers of the law and the chief priests looked for a way to arrest him immediately, because they knew he had spoken this parable against them. But they were afraid of the people.\n\nThey sent spies, who pretended to be sincere, to catch him in something he said, so they might hand him over to the power and authority of the governor. So they questioned him, \"Teacher, we know that you speak and teach what is right, and that you do not show partiality but teach the way of God in accordance with the truth. Is it right for us to pay taxes to Caesar or not?\" Jesus saw through their trickery and said to them, \"Show me a denarius. Whose image and inscription are on it?\" \"Caesar's,\" they replied. He said to them, \"Then give back to Caesar what is Caesar's, and to God what is God's.\"\n\nThey were unable to trap him in what he had said there in public. And astonished by his answer, they became silent.\n\nSome of the Sadducees, who say there is no resurrection, came to Jesus with a question. \"Teacher,\" they said, \"Moses wrote for us that if a man's brother dies and leaves a wife but no children, the man must marry the widow and raise up offspring for his brother. Now there were seven brothers. The first one married a woman and died childless. The second and then the third married her, and in the same way, the seven died, leaving no children. Finally, the woman died too. Now then, at the resurrection, whose wife will she be, since the seven were married to her?\"\n\nJesus replied, \"The people of this age marry and are given in marriage. But those who are considered worthy of taking part in the age to come and in the resurrection from the dead will neither marry nor be given in marriage, and they can no longer die; for they are like the angels. They are God's children, since they are children of the resurrection. But in the account of the burning bush, even Moses showed that the dead rise, for he calls the Lord 'the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.' He is not the God of the dead, but of the living, for to him all are alive.\"\n\nSome of the teachers of the law responded, \"Well said, teacher!\" And no one dared to ask him any more questions.\n\nThen Jesus said to them, \"Why is it said that the Messiah is the son of David? David himself declares in the Book of Psalms: 'The Lord said to my Lord: \"Sit at my right hand until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet.\"' David calls him 'Lord.' How then can he be his son?\"\n\nWhile all the people were listening, Jesus said to his disciples, \"Beware of the teachers of the law. They like to walk around in flowing robes and love to be greeted with respect in the marketplaces and have the most important seats in the synagogues and the places of honor at banquets. They devour widows' houses and for a show make lengthy prayers.

Jesus said, \"As for what you see here, the time will come when not one stone will be left on another; every one of them will be thrown down.\"\n\nThey asked him, \"Teacher, when will these things happen? And what will be the sign that they are about to take place?\"\n\nHe replied, \"Watch out that you are not deceived. For many will come in my name, claiming, 'I am he,' and, 'The time is near.'

When they sprout leaves, you can see for yourselves and know that summer is near. Even so, when you see these things happening, you know that the kingdom of God is near.\n\nTruly I tell you, this generation will certainly not pass away until all these things have happened.

The chief priests and scribes were looking for a way to kill Jesus, but they were afraid of the people. Then Satan entered Judas Iscariot, one of the twelve disciples. Judas went to the chief priests and officers to discuss how he could betray Jesus to them. They were glad and agreed to give him money. Judas accepted and looked for an opportunity to betray Jesus when there was no crowd around.\n\nThe day of Unleavened Bread came, when the Passover lamb had to be sacrificed. Jesus sent Peter and John, saying, \"Go and prepare the Passover meal for us to eat.\" They asked, \"Where do you want us to prepare it?\" Jesus replied, \"When you enter the city, a man carrying a jar of water will meet you. Follow him to the house he enters and say to the owner, 'The Teacher asks, where is the guest room where I can eat the Passover with my disciples?' He will show you a large, furnished room upstairs. Prepare the meal there.\" They went and found everything as Jesus had told them and prepared the Passover.\n\nWhen the time came, Jesus sat down with the apostles and said, \"I have eagerly desired to eat this Passover with you before I suffer. I tell you, I will not eat it again until it is fulfilled in the kingdom of God.\" He took a cup, gave thanks, and said, \"Take this and share it among yourselves. I tell you, I will not drink from the fruit of the vine until the kingdom of God comes.\" He took bread, gave thanks, broke it, and gave it to them, saying, \"This is my body given for you; do this in remembrance of me.\" In the same way, after the meal, he took the cup, saying, \"This cup is the new covenant in my blood, poured out for you. But look, the hand of the one who betrays me is with mine on the table. The Son of Man will go as it has been decreed, but woe to that man who betrays him.\" They began to question among themselves which of them might do this.\n\nA dispute also arose among them about who was considered to be the greatest. Jesus said to them, \"The kings of the Gentiles lord it over them, and those who exercise authority over them call themselves Benefactors. But you are not to be like that. Instead, the greatest among you should be like the youngest, and the one who rules like the one who serves. For who is greater, the one who is at the table or the one who serves? Is it not the one who is at the table? But I am among you as one who serves. You are those who have stood by me in my trials. And I confer on you a kingdom, just as my Father conferred one on me, so that you may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom and sit on thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.\n\nSimon, Simon, Satan has asked to sift all of you as wheat. But I have prayed for you, Simon, that your faith may not fail. And when you have turned back, strengthen your brothers.\" But Peter replied, \"Lord, I am ready to go with you to prison and to death.\" Jesus answered, \"I tell you, Peter, before the rooster crows today, you will deny three times that you know me.\"\n\nThen Jesus asked them, \"When I sent you without purse, bag, or sandals, did you lack anything?\" \"Nothing,\" they answered. He said to them, \"But now if you have a purse, take it, and also a bag; and if you don't have a sword, sell your cloak and buy one. It is written: 'And he was numbered with the transgressors'; and I tell you that this must be fulfilled in me. Yes, what is written about me is reaching its fulfillment.\" The disciples said, \"See, Lord, here are two swords.\" \"That's enough!\" he replied.\n\nJesus went out as usual to the Mount of Olives, and his disciples followed him. On reaching the place, he said to them, \"Pray that you will not fall into temptation.\" He withdrew about a stone's throw beyond them, knelt down, and prayed, \"Father, if you are willing, take this cup from me; yet not my will, but yours be done.\" When he rose from prayer and went back to the disciples, he found them asleep, exhausted from sorrow. \"Why are you sleeping?\" he asked them. \"Get up and pray so that you will not fall into temptation.\"\n\nWhile he was still speaking, a crowd came up, and Judas, one of the Twelve, was leading them. He approached Jesus to kiss him, but Jesus asked him, \"Judas, are you betraying the Son of Man with a kiss?\" When Jesus' followers saw what was going to happen, they said, \"Lord, should we strike with our swords?\" And one of them struck the servant of the high priest, cutting off his right ear. But Jesus answered, \"No more of this!\" And he touched the man's ear and healed him.\n\nThen Jesus said to the chief priests, the officers of the temple guard, and the elders, who had come for him, \"Am I leading a rebellion, that you have come with swords and clubs? Every day I was with you in the temple courts, and you did not lay a hand on me. But this is your hour--when darkness reigns.\"\n\nThen they seized him and led him away, bringing him into the high priest's house. Peter followed at a distance. When they had kindled a fire in the middle of the courtyard and sat down together, Peter sat down with them. A servant girl saw him seated there in the firelight. She looked closely at him and said, \"This man was with him.\" But he denied it. \"Woman, I don't know him,\" he said. A little later someone else saw him and said, \"You also are one of them.\" \"Man, I am not!\" Peter replied. About an hour later another asserted, \"Certainly this fellow was with him, for he is a Galilean.\" Peter replied, \"Man, I don't know what you're talking about!\" Just as he was speaking, the rooster crowed. The Lord turned and looked straight at Peter. Then Peter remembered the word the Lord had spoken to him: \"Before the rooster crows today, you will disown me three times.\" And he went outside and wept bitterly.\n\nThe men who were guarding Jesus began mocking and beating him. They blindfolded him and demanded, \"Prophesy! Who hit you?\" And they said many other insulting things to him.\n\nAt daybreak, the council of the elders of the people, both the chief priests and the teachers of the law, met together, and Jesus was led before them. \"If you are the Messiah,\" they said, \"tell us.\" Jesus answered, \"If I tell you, you will not believe me, and if I asked you, you would not answer. But from now on, the Son of Man will be seated at the right hand of the mighty God.\" They all asked, \"Are you then the Son of God?\" He replied, \"You say that I am.\" Then they said, \"Why do we need any more testimony? We have heard it from his own lips.\""}], "temperature": 0, "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"name": "schema", "schema": {"properties": {"translation": {"type": "string"}}, "required": ["translation"], "type": "object"}}}}}

They started accusing him, saying, \"We found this man misleading our nation, stopping people from paying taxes to Caesar, and claiming to be Christ, a king.\" Pilate asked him, \"Are you the king of the Jews?\" Jesus replied, \"You say so.\" Pilate then told the chief priests and the crowd, \"I find no fault in this man.\" But they insisted, saying, \"He stirs up the people, teaching all over Judea, starting from Galilee to here.\" When Pilate heard this, he asked if the man was a Galilean. Finding out he was under Herod's jurisdiction, he sent him to Herod, who was also in Jerusalem at that time. Herod was very happy to see Jesus because he had wanted to see him for a long time, having heard about him and hoping to see him perform a miracle. Herod questioned him at length, but Jesus gave no answer. The chief priests and scribes stood by, accusing him strongly. Herod, along with his soldiers, mocked Jesus, dressed him in a splendid robe, and sent him back to Pilate. That day, Herod and Pilate became friends, though they had been enemies before.\n\nPilate called together the chief priests, the rulers, and the people, and said, \"You brought this man to me as one who incites the people to rebellion. I have examined him in your presence and found no basis for your charges against him. Neither has Herod, for he sent him back to us. As you can see, he has done nothing deserving death. Therefore, I will punish him and release him.\" But the whole crowd shouted, \"Away with this man! Release Barabbas to us!\" Barabbas had been thrown into prison for an uprising in the city and for murder. Wanting to release Jesus, Pilate appealed to them again, but they kept shouting, \"Crucify him! Crucify him!\" For the third time, he spoke to them, \"Why? What crime has this man committed? I have found in him no grounds for the death penalty. Therefore, I will punish him and release him.\" But they kept shouting loudly, demanding that he be crucified, and their voices prevailed. So Pilate decided to grant their demand. He released the man who had been thrown into prison for insurrection and murder, the one they asked for, and surrendered Jesus to their will.\n\nAs they led him away, they seized Simon from Cyrene, who was on his way in from the country, and put the cross on him to carry behind Jesus. A large number of people followed him, including women who mourned and wailed for him. Jesus turned and said to them, \"Daughters of Jerusalem, do not weep for me; weep for yourselves and for your children. For the time will come when you will say, 'Blessed are the childless women, the wombs that never bore and the breasts that never nursed!' Then they will say to the mountains, 'Fall on us!' and to the hills, 'Cover us!' For if people do these things when the tree is green, what will happen when it is dry?\"\n\nTwo other men, both criminals, were also led out with him to be executed. When they came to the place called the Skull, they crucified him there, along with the criminals--one on his right, the other on his left. They divided up his clothes by casting lots. The people stood watching, and the rulers even sneered at him. They said, \"He saved others; let him save himself if he is God's Messiah, the Chosen One.\" The soldiers also came up and mocked him. They offered him wine vinegar and said, \"If you are the king of the Jews, save yourself.\" There was a written notice above him, which read: THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS.\n\nOne of the criminals who hung there hurled insults at him: \"Aren't you the Messiah? Save yourself and us!\" But the other criminal rebuked him. \"Don't you fear God,\" he said, \"since you are under the same sentence? We are punished justly, for we are getting what our deeds deserve. But this man has done nothing wrong.\" Then he said, \"Jesus, remember me when you come into your kingdom.\" Jesus answered him, \"Truly I tell you, today you will be with me in paradise.\"\n\nIt was now about noon, and darkness came over the whole land until three in the afternoon, for the sun stopped shining. And the curtain of the temple was torn in two. Jesus called out with a loud voice, \"Father, into your hands I commit my spirit.\" When he had said this, he breathed his last.\n\nThe centurion, seeing what had happened, praised God and said, \"Surely this was a righteous man.\" When all the people who had gathered to witness this sight saw what took place, they beat their breasts and went away. But all those who knew him, including the women who had followed him from Galilee, stood at a distance, watching these things.\n\nNow there was a man named Joseph, a member of the Council, a good and upright man, who had not consented to their decision and action. He came from the Judean town of Arimathea and he was waiting for the kingdom of God. Going to Pilate, he asked for Jesus' body. Then he took it down, wrapped it in linen cloth, and placed it in a tomb cut in the rock, one in which no one had yet been laid. It was Preparation Day, and the Sabbath was about to begin. The women who had come with Jesus from Galilee followed Joseph and saw the tomb and how his body was laid in it. Then they went home and prepared spices and perfumes. But they rested on the Sabbath in obedience to the commandment."}], "temperature": 0, "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"name": "schema", "schema": {"properties": {"translation": {"type": "string"}}, "required": ["translation"], "type": "object"}}}}}

They found the stone rolled away from the tomb, but when they entered, they did not find the body of the Lord Jesus. While they were wondering about this, suddenly two men in clothes that gleamed like lightning stood beside them. In their fright, the women bowed down with their faces to the ground, but the men said to them, \"Why do you look for the living among the dead? He is not here; he has risen! Remember how he told you, while he was still with you in Galilee: 'The Son of Man must be delivered over to the hands of sinners, be crucified and on the third day be raised again.'\" Then they remembered his words.\n\nWhen they came back from the tomb, they told all these things to the Eleven and to all the others. It was Mary Magdalene, Joanna, Mary the mother of James, and the others with them who told this to the apostles. But they did not believe the women, because their words seemed to them like nonsense. Peter, however, got up and ran to the tomb. Bending over, he saw the strips of linen lying by themselves, and he went away, wondering to himself what had happened.\n\nNow that same day two of them were going to a village called Emmaus, about seven miles from Jerusalem. They were talking with each other about everything that had happened. As they talked and discussed these things with each other, Jesus himself came up and walked along with them; but they were kept from recognizing him.\n\nHe asked them, \"What are you discussing together as you walk along?\" They stood still, their faces downcast. One of them, named Cleopas, asked him, \"Are you the only one visiting Jerusalem who does not know the things that have happened there in these days?\"\n\n\"What things?\" he asked.\n\n\"About Jesus of Nazareth,\" they replied. \"He was a prophet, powerful in word and deed before God and all the people. The chief priests and our rulers handed him over to be sentenced to death, and they crucified him; but we had hoped that he was the one who was going to redeem Israel. And what is more, it is the third day since all this took place. In addition, some of our women amazed us. They went to the tomb early this morning but didn't find his body. They came and told us that they had seen a vision of angels, who said he was alive. Then some of our companions went to the tomb and found it just as the women had said, but they did not see Jesus.\"\n\nHe said to them, \"How foolish you are, and how slow to believe all that the prophets have spoken! Did not the Messiah have to suffer these things and then enter his glory?\" And beginning with Moses and all the Prophets, he explained to them what was said in all the Scriptures concerning himself.\n\nAs they approached the village to which they were going, Jesus continued on as if he were going farther. But they urged him strongly, \"Stay with us, for it is nearly evening; the day is almost over.\" So he went in to stay with them.\n\nWhen he was at the table with them, he took bread, gave thanks, broke it and began to give it to them. Then their eyes were opened and they recognized him, and he disappeared from their sight. They asked each other, \"Were not our hearts burning within us while he talked with us on the road and opened the Scriptures to us?\"\n\nThey got up and returned at once to Jerusalem. There they found the Eleven and those with them, assembled together and saying, \"It is true! The Lord has risen and has appeared to Simon.\" Then the two told what had happened on the way, and how Jesus was recognized by them when he broke the bread.\n\nWhile they were still talking about this, Jesus himself stood among them and said to them, \"Peace be with you.\" They were startled and frightened, thinking they saw a ghost. He said to them, \"Why are you troubled, and why do doubts rise in your minds? Look at my hands and my feet. It is I myself! Touch me and see; a ghost does not have flesh and bones, as you see I have.\" When he had said this, he showed them his hands and feet. And while they still did not believe it because of joy and amazement, he asked them, \"Do you have anything here to eat?\" They gave him a piece of broiled fish, and he took it and ate it in their presence.\n\nHe said to them, \"This is what I told you while I was still with you: Everything must be fulfilled that is written about me in the Law of Moses, the Prophets and the Psalms.\" Then he opened their minds so they could understand the Scriptures. He told them, \"This is what is written: The Messiah will suffer and rise from the dead on the third day, and repentance for the forgiveness of sins will be preached in his name to all nations, beginning at Jerusalem. You are witnesses of these things. I am going to send you what my Father has promised; but stay in the city until you have been clothed with power from on high.\"\n\nWhen he had led them out to the vicinity of Bethany, he lifted up his hands and blessed them. While he was blessing them, he left them and was taken up into heaven. Then they worshiped him and returned to Jerusalem with great joy. And they stayed continually at the temple, praising God."}], "temperature": 0, "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"name": "schema", "schema": {"properties": {"translation": {"type": "string"}}, "required": ["translation"], "type": "object"}}}}}
