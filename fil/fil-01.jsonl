A voice of one calling in the wilderness, 'Prepare the way for the Lord, make straight paths for him.'\" John the Baptist appeared in the wilderness, preaching a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins. People from all over Judea and Jerusalem went out to him, confessing their sins, and were baptized by him in the Jordan River. John wore clothes made of camel's hair, with a leather belt around his waist, and he ate locusts and wild honey. He preached, saying, \"After me comes someone more powerful than I, whose sandals I am not worthy to untie. I baptize you with water, but he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit.\"\n\nAt that time, Jesus came from Nazareth in Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan. As Jesus was coming up out of the water, he saw heaven being torn open and the Spirit descending on him like a dove. A voice came from heaven: \"You are my Son, whom I love; with you I am well pleased.\" Immediately, the Spirit sent him out into the wilderness, and he was in the wilderness for forty days, being tempted by Satan. He was with the wild animals, and angels attended him.\n\nAfter John was put in prison, Jesus went into Galilee, proclaiming the good news of God. \"The time has come,\" he said. \"The kingdom of God has come near. Repent and believe the good news!\"\n\nAs Jesus walked beside the Sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and his brother Andrew casting a net into the lake, for they were fishermen. \"Come, follow me,\" Jesus said, \"and I will send you out to fish for people.\" At once they left their nets and followed him. When he had gone a little farther, he saw James son of Zebedee and his brother John in a boat, preparing their nets. Without delay, he called them, and they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired men and followed him.\n\nThey went to Capernaum, and when the Sabbath came, Jesus went into the synagogue and began to teach. The people were amazed at his teaching, because he taught them as one who had authority, not as the teachers of the law. Just then a man in their synagogue who was possessed by an impure spirit cried out, \"What do you want with us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are--the Holy One of God!\" \"Be quiet!\" said Jesus sternly. \"Come out of him!\" The impure spirit shook the man violently and came out of him with a shriek.\n\nThe people were all so amazed that they asked each other, \"What is this? A new teaching--and with authority! He even gives orders to impure spirits and they obey him.\" News about him spread quickly over the whole region of Galilee.\n\nAs soon as they left the synagogue, they went with James and John to the home of Simon and Andrew. Simon's mother-in-law was in bed with a fever, and they immediately told Jesus about her. So he went to her, took her hand and helped her up. The fever left her and she began to wait on them.\n\nThat evening after sunset, the people brought to Jesus all the sick and demon-possessed. The whole town gathered at the door, and Jesus healed many who had various diseases. He also drove out many demons, but he would not let the demons speak because they knew who he was.\n\nVery early in the morning, while it was still dark, Jesus got up, left the house and went off to a solitary place, where he prayed. Simon and his companions went to look for him, and when they found him, they exclaimed: \"Everyone is looking for you!\" Jesus replied, \"Let us go somewhere else--to the nearby villages--so I can preach there also. That is why I have come.\" So he traveled throughout Galilee, preaching in their synagogues and driving out demons.\n\nA man with leprosy came to him and begged him on his knees, \"If you are willing, you can make me clean.\" Jesus was indignant. He reached out his hand and touched the man. \"I am willing,\" he said. \"Be clean!\" Immediately the leprosy left him and he was cleansed. Jesus sent him away at once with a strong warning: \"See that you don't tell this to anyone. But go, show yourself to the priest and offer the sacrifices that Moses commanded for your cleansing, as a testimony to them.\" Instead he went out and began to talk freely, spreading the news. As a result, Jesus could no longer enter a town openly but stayed outside in lonely places. Yet the people still came to him from everywhere."}], "temperature": 0, "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"name": "schema", "schema": {"properties": {"translation": {"type": "string"}}, "required": ["translation"], "type": "object"}}}}}

So many gathered that there was no room left, not even outside the door. He was speaking to them, and some people came bringing a paralyzed man carried by four others. They couldn't get him to Jesus because of the crowd, so they made an opening in the roof above Jesus and lowered the man on his mat. Seeing their faith, Jesus said to the paralyzed man, \"Son, your sins are forgiven.\"\n\nSome teachers of the law were sitting there, thinking to themselves, \"Why does this fellow talk like that? He's blaspheming! Who can forgive sins but God alone?\" Immediately, Jesus knew in his spirit that this was what they were thinking, and he said to them, \"Why are you thinking these things? Which is easier: to say to this paralyzed man, 'Your sins are forgiven,' or to say, 'Get up, take your mat and walk'? But I want you to know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins.\" So he said to the man, \"I tell you, get up, take your mat and go home.\" He got up, took his mat, and walked out in full view of them all. This amazed everyone, and they praised God, saying, \"We have never seen anything like this!\"\n\nJesus went out beside the lake again, and a large crowd came to him, and he taught them. As he walked along, he saw Levi, son of Alphaeus, sitting at the tax collector's booth. \"Follow me,\" Jesus told him, and Levi got up and followed him.\n\nWhile Jesus was having dinner at Levi's house, many tax collectors and sinners were eating with him and his disciples, for there were many who followed him. When the teachers of the law who were Pharisees saw him eating with the sinners and tax collectors, they asked his disciples, \"Why does he eat with tax collectors and sinners?\" On hearing this, Jesus said to them, \"It is not the healthy who need a doctor, but the sick. I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners.\"\n\nNow John's disciples and the Pharisees were fasting. Some people came and asked Jesus, \"How is it that John's disciples and the disciples of the Pharisees are fasting, but yours are not?\" Jesus answered, \"How can the guests of the bridegroom fast while he is with them? They cannot, so long as they have him with them. But the time will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them, and on that day they will fast.\"\n\n\"No one sews a patch of unshrunk cloth on an old garment. Otherwise, the new piece will pull away from the old, making the tear worse. And no one pours new wine into old wineskins. Otherwise, the wine will burst the skins, and both the wine and the wineskins will be ruined. No, they pour new wine into new wineskins.\"\n\nOne Sabbath, Jesus was going through the grainfields, and his disciples began to pick some heads of grain. The Pharisees said to him, \"Look, why are they doing what is unlawful on the Sabbath?\" He answered, \"Have you never read what David did when he and his companions were hungry and in need? In the days of Abiathar the high priest, he entered the house of God and ate the consecrated bread, which is lawful only for priests to eat. And he also gave some to his companions.\" Then he said to them, \"The Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath. So the Son of Man is Lord even of the Sabbath.\""}], "temperature": 0, "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"name": "schema", "schema": {"properties": {"translation": {"type": "string"}}, "required": ["translation"], "type": "object"}}}}}

People were watching to see if Jesus would heal him on the Sabbath so they could accuse him. Jesus told the man to stand in the middle and asked the people if it was right to do good or harm on the Sabbath, to save a life or to kill. They stayed silent. Jesus was angry and sad about their stubborn hearts. He told the man to stretch out his hand, and when he did, it was healed. The Pharisees left and started plotting with the Herodians on how to kill Jesus.\n\nJesus and his disciples went to the sea, and a large crowd from Galilee, Judea, Jerusalem, Idumea, beyond the Jordan, and around Tyre and Sidon followed him because they heard about what he was doing. Jesus told his disciples to have a small boat ready for him because of the crowd, so they wouldn't crush him. He healed many people, and those with diseases were trying to touch him. Whenever unclean spirits saw him, they fell down and shouted, \"You are the Son of God!\" But Jesus ordered them not to make him known.\n\nJesus went up a mountain and called those he wanted, and they came to him. He appointed twelve apostles to be with him and to send them out to preach and have authority to drive out demons. He named Simon \"Peter,\" James and John \"Sons of Thunder,\" and included Andrew, Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew, Thomas, James son of Alphaeus, Thaddaeus, Simon the Zealot, and Judas Iscariot, who later betrayed him.\n\nJesus went into a house, and a crowd gathered again, making it hard for them to eat. When his family heard about it, they went to take charge of him, saying he was out of his mind. Teachers of the law from Jerusalem said he was possessed by Beelzebul and that he drove out demons by the prince of demons. Jesus called them and spoke in parables, asking how Satan could drive out Satan. He said a kingdom or house divided against itself cannot stand. He explained that no one can enter a strong man's house and steal his possessions unless he first ties up the strong man.\n\nJesus said all sins and blasphemies will be forgiven, but whoever blasphemes against the Holy Spirit will never be forgiven and is guilty of an eternal sin. This was because they said he had an unclean spirit.\n\nJesus' mother and brothers arrived and stood outside, sending someone to call him. A crowd was sitting around him, and they told him, \"Your mother and brothers are outside looking for you.\" Jesus replied, \"Who are my mother and brothers?\" He looked at those sitting around him and said, \"Here are my mother and brothers!

He got into a boat and sat in it on the sea, while the whole crowd was on the land by the sea. He taught them many things in parables and said to them in his teaching, \"Listen! A sower went out to sow. As he sowed, some seed fell along the path, and the birds came and ate it up. Other seed fell on rocky ground, where it didn't have much soil, and it sprang up quickly because the soil was shallow. But when the sun came up, the plants were scorched, and they withered because they had no root. Other seed fell among thorns, which grew up and choked the plants, so they did not bear grain. Still other seed fell on good soil. It came up, grew, and produced a crop, multiplying thirty, sixty, or even a hundred times.\" Then he said, \"Whoever has ears to hear, let them hear.\"\n\nWhen he was alone, the Twelve and the others around him asked him about the parables. He told them, \"The secret of the kingdom of God has been given to you. But to those on the outside, everything is said in parables so that, 'they may be ever seeing but never perceiving, and ever hearing but never understanding; otherwise they might turn and be forgiven!'\"\n\nThen Jesus said to them, \"Don't you understand this parable? How then will you understand any parable? The farmer sows the word. Some people are like seed along the path, where the word is sown. As soon as they hear it, Satan comes and takes away the word that was sown in them. Others, like seed sown on rocky places, hear the word and at once receive it with joy. But since they have no root, they last only a short time. When trouble or persecution comes because of the word, they quickly fall away. Still others, like seed sown among thorns, hear the word; but the worries of this life, the deceitfulness of wealth, and the desires for other things come in and choke the word, making it unfruitful. Others, like seed sown on good soil, hear the word, accept it, and produce a crop--thirty, sixty, or even a hundred times what was sown.\"\n\nHe also said to them, \"Do you bring in a lamp to put it under a bowl or a bed? Instead, don't you put it on its stand? For whatever is hidden is meant to be disclosed, and whatever is concealed is meant to be brought out into the open. If anyone has ears to hear, let them hear.\"\n\n\"Consider carefully what you hear,\" he continued. \"With the measure you use, it will be measured to you--and even more. Whoever has will be given more; whoever does not have, even what they have will be taken from them.\"\n\nHe also said, \"This is what the kingdom of God is like. A man scatters seed on the ground. Night and day, whether he sleeps or gets up, the seed sprouts and grows, though he does not know how. All by itself the soil produces grain--first the stalk, then the head, then the full kernel in the head. As soon as the grain is ripe, he puts the sickle to it, because the harvest has come.\"\n\nAgain he said, \"What shall we say the kingdom of God is like, or what parable shall we use to describe it? It is like a mustard seed, which is the smallest of all seeds on earth. Yet when planted, it grows and becomes the largest of all garden plants, with such big branches that the birds can perch in its shade.\"\n\nWith many similar parables, Jesus spoke the word to them, as much as they could understand. He did not say anything to them without using a parable. But when he was alone with his own disciples, he explained everything.\n\nThat day when evening came, he said to his disciples, \"Let us go over to the other side.\" Leaving the crowd behind, they took him along, just as he was, in the boat. There were also other boats with him. A furious squall came up, and the waves broke over the boat, so that it was nearly swamped. Jesus was in the stern, sleeping on a cushion. The disciples woke him and said to him, \"Teacher, don't you care if we drown?\"\n\nHe got up, rebuked the wind, and said to the waves, \"Quiet! Be still!\" Then the wind died down, and it was completely calm. He said to his disciples, \"Why are you so afraid? Do you still have no faith?\"\n\nThey were terrified and asked each other, \"Who is this?

As soon as Jesus got out of the boat, a man with an unclean spirit came from the tombs to meet him. This man lived in the tombs, and no one could bind him anymore, not even with a chain. He had often been chained hand and foot, but he tore the chains apart and broke the irons on his feet. No one was strong enough to subdue him. Night and day among the tombs and in the hills he would cry out and cut himself with stones.\n\nWhen he saw Jesus from a distance, he ran and fell on his knees in front of him. He shouted at the top of his voice, \"What do you want with me, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? In God's name don't torture me!\" For Jesus had said to him, \"Come out of this man, you impure spirit!\"\n\nThen Jesus asked him, \"What is your name?\"\n\n\"My name is Legion,\" he replied, \"for we are many.\" And he begged Jesus again and again not to send them out of the area.\n\nA large herd of pigs was feeding on the nearby hillside. The demons begged Jesus, \"Send us among the pigs; allow us to go into them.\" He gave them permission, and the impure spirits came out and went into the pigs. The herd, about two thousand in number, rushed down the steep bank into the lake and were drowned.\n\nThose tending the pigs ran off and reported this in the town and countryside, and the people went out to see what had happened. When they came to Jesus, they saw the man who had been possessed by the legion of demons, sitting there, dressed and in his right mind; and they were afraid. Those who had seen it told the people what had happened to the demon-possessed man--and told about the pigs as well. Then the people began to plead with Jesus to leave their region.\n\nAs Jesus was getting into the boat, the man who had been demon-possessed begged to go with him. Jesus did not let him, but said, \"Go home to your own people and tell them how much the Lord has done for you, and how he has had mercy on you.\" So the man went away and began to tell in the Decapolis how much Jesus had done for him. And all the people were amazed.\n\nWhen Jesus had again crossed over by boat to the other side of the lake, a large crowd gathered around him while he was by the lake. Then one of the synagogue leaders, named Jairus, came, and when he saw Jesus, he fell at his feet. He pleaded earnestly with him, \"My little daughter is dying. Please come and put your hands on her so that she will be healed and live.\" So Jesus went with him.\n\nA large crowd followed and pressed around him. And a woman was there who had been subject to bleeding for twelve years. She had suffered a great deal under the care of many doctors and had spent all she had, yet instead of getting better she grew worse. When she heard about Jesus, she came up behind him in the crowd and touched his cloak, because she thought, \"If I just touch his clothes, I will be healed.\" Immediately her bleeding stopped and she felt in her body that she was freed from her suffering.\n\nAt once Jesus realized that power had gone out from him. He turned around in the crowd and asked, \"Who touched my clothes?\"\n\n\"You see the people crowding against you,\" his disciples answered, \"and yet you can ask, 'Who touched me?'\"\n\nBut Jesus kept looking around to see who had done it. Then the woman, knowing what had happened to her, came and fell at his feet and, trembling with fear, told him the whole truth. He said to her, \"Daughter, your faith has healed you. Go in peace and be freed from your suffering.\"\n\nWhile Jesus was still speaking, some people came from the house of Jairus, the synagogue leader. \"Your daughter is dead,\" they said. \"Why bother the teacher anymore?\"\n\nOverhearing what they said, Jesus told him, \"Don't be afraid; just believe.\" He did not let anyone follow him except Peter, James, and John the brother of James. When they came to the home of the synagogue leader, Jesus saw a commotion, with people crying and wailing loudly. He went in and said to them, \"Why all this commotion and wailing? The child is not dead but asleep.\" But they laughed at him.\n\nAfter he put them all out, he took the child's father and mother and the disciples who were with him, and went in where the child was. He took her by the hand and said to her, \"Talitha koum!\" (which means \"Little girl, I say to you, get up!\"). Immediately the girl stood up and began to walk around (she was twelve years old). At this they were completely astonished. He gave strict orders not to let anyone know about this, and told them to give her something to eat."}], "temperature": 0, "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"name": "schema", "schema": {"properties": {"translation": {"type": "string"}}, "required": ["translation"], "type": "object"}}}}}

On the Sabbath, he began teaching in the synagogue, and many who heard him were amazed. They asked, \"Where did he get these things? What is this wisdom that has been given to him, and what are these remarkable miracles he is performing? Isn't this the carpenter, the son of Mary, and the brother of James, Joseph, Judas, and Simon? Aren't his sisters here with us?\" And they took offense at him.\n\nJesus said to them, \"A prophet is not without honor except in his own town, among his relatives, and in his own home.\" He could not do any miracles there, except lay his hands on a few sick people and heal them. He was amazed at their lack of faith.\n\nThen Jesus went around teaching from village to village. Calling the Twelve to him, he began to send them out two by two and gave them authority over impure spirits. He instructed them to take nothing for the journey except a staff--no bread, no bag, no money in their belts. Wear sandals but not an extra shirt. \"Whenever you enter a house, stay there until you leave that town. And if any place will not welcome you or listen to you, leave that place and shake the dust off your feet as a testimony against them.\"\n\nThey went out and preached that people should repent. They drove out many demons and anointed many sick people with oil and healed them.\n\nKing Herod heard about this, for Jesus' name had become well known. Some were saying, \"John the Baptist has been raised from the dead, and that is why miraculous powers are at work in him.\" Others said, \"He is Elijah.\" And still others claimed, \"He is a prophet, like one of the prophets of long ago.\"\n\nBut when Herod heard this, he said, \"John, whom I beheaded, has been raised from the dead!\" For Herod himself had given orders to have John arrested, and he had him bound and put in prison. He did this because of Herodias, his brother Philip's wife, whom he had married. For John had been saying to Herod, \"It is not lawful for you to have your brother's wife.\" So Herodias nursed a grudge against John and wanted to kill him. But she was not able to, because Herod feared John and protected him, knowing him to be a righteous and holy man. When Herod heard John, he was greatly puzzled, yet he liked to listen to him.\n\nFinally, the opportune time came. On his birthday, Herod gave a banquet for his high officials and military commanders and the leading men of Galilee. When the daughter of Herodias came in and danced, she pleased Herod and his dinner guests. The king said to the girl, \"Ask me for anything you want, and I'll give it to you.\" And he promised her with an oath, \"Whatever you ask I will give you, up to half my kingdom.\"\n\nShe went out and said to her mother, \"What shall I ask for?\"\n\n\"The head of John the Baptist,\" she answered.\n\nAt once the girl hurried in to the king with the request: \"I want you to give me right now the head of John the Baptist on a platter.\"\n\nThe king was greatly distressed, but because of his oaths and his dinner guests, he did not want to refuse her. So he immediately sent an executioner with orders to bring John's head. The man went, beheaded John in the prison, and brought back his head on a platter. He presented it to the girl, and she gave it to her mother. On hearing of this, John's disciples came and took his body and laid it in a tomb.\n\nThe apostles gathered around Jesus and reported to him all they had done and taught. Then, because so many people were coming and going that they did not even have a chance to eat, he said to them, \"Come with me by yourselves to a quiet place and get some rest.\" So they went away by themselves in a boat to a solitary place.\n\nBut many who saw them leaving recognized them and ran on foot from all the towns and got there ahead of them. When Jesus landed and saw a large crowd, he had compassion on them, because they were like sheep without a shepherd. So he began teaching them many things.\n\nBy this time it was late in the day, so his disciples came to him. \"This is a remote place,\" they said, \"and it's already very late. Send the people away so that they can go to the surrounding countryside and villages and buy themselves something to eat.\"\n\nBut he answered, \"You give them something to eat.\"\n\nThey said to him, \"That would take more than half a year's wages! Are we to go and spend that much on bread and give it to them to eat?\"\n\n\"How many loaves do you have?\" he asked. \"Go and see.\"\n\nWhen they found out, they said, \"Five--and two fish.\"\n\nThen Jesus directed them to have all the people sit down in groups on the green grass. So they sat down in groups of hundreds and fifties. Taking the five loaves and the two fish and looking up to heaven, he gave thanks and broke the loaves. Then he gave them to his disciples to distribute to the people. He also divided the two fish among them all. They all ate and were satisfied, and the disciples picked up twelve basketfuls of broken pieces of bread and fish. The number of the men who had eaten was five thousand.\n\nImmediately Jesus made his disciples get into the boat and go on ahead of him to Bethsaida, while he dismissed the crowd. After leaving them, he went up on a mountainside to pray.\n\nLater that night, the boat was in the middle of the lake, and he was alone on land. He saw the disciples straining at the oars, because the wind was against them. Shortly before dawn he went out to them, walking on the lake. He was about to pass by them, but when they saw him walking on the lake, they thought he was a ghost. They cried out, because they all saw him and were terrified.\n\nImmediately he spoke to them and said, \"Take courage! It is I. Don't be afraid.\" Then he climbed into the boat with them, and the wind died down. They were completely amazed, for they had not understood about the loaves; their hearts were hardened.\n\nWhen they had crossed over, they landed at Gennesaret and anchored there. As soon as they got out of the boat, people recognized Jesus. They ran throughout that whole region and carried the sick on mats to wherever they heard he was. And wherever he went--into villages, towns, or countryside--they placed the sick in the marketplaces. They begged him to let them touch even the edge of his cloak, and all who touched it were healed."}], "temperature": 0, "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"name": "schema", "schema": {"properties": {"translation": {"type": "string"}}, "required": ["translation"], "type": "object"}}}}}

They noticed that some of his disciples were eating with unwashed hands, which was against the tradition of the elders. The Pharisees and all the Jews do not eat unless they wash their hands properly, following the tradition of the elders. They also do not eat after coming from the market unless they wash, and they follow many other traditions like washing cups, pitchers, and kettles.\n\nThe Pharisees and teachers of the law asked Jesus, \"Why don't your disciples follow the tradition of the elders and eat with unwashed hands?\" Jesus replied, \"Isaiah was right when he prophesied about you hypocrites; as it is written: 'These people honor me with their lips, but their hearts are far from me. They worship me in vain; their teachings are merely human rules.' You have let go of the commands of God and are holding on to human traditions.\"\n\nJesus continued, \"You have a fine way of setting aside the commands of God to observe your own traditions! For Moses said, 'Honor your father and mother,' and, 'Anyone who curses their father or mother is to be put to death.' But you say that if anyone declares that what might have been used to help their father or mother is 'Corban' (that is, devoted to God), then you no longer let them do anything for their father or mother. Thus you nullify the word of God by your tradition that you have handed down. And you do many things like that.\"\n\nAgain Jesus called the crowd to him and said, \"Listen to me, everyone, and understand this. Nothing outside a person can defile them by going into them. Rather, it is what comes out of a person that defiles them.\" After he had left the crowd and entered the house, his disciples asked him about this parable. \"Are you so dull?\" he asked. \"Don't you see that nothing that enters a person from the outside can defile them? For it doesn't go into their heart but into their stomach, and then out of the body.\" (In saying this, Jesus declared all foods clean.)\n\nHe went on: \"What comes out of a person is what defiles them. For it is from within, out of a person's heart, that evil thoughts come--sexual immorality, theft, murder, adultery, greed, malice, deceit, lewdness, envy, slander, arrogance, and folly. All these evils come from inside and defile a person.\"\n\nJesus left that place and went to the vicinity of Tyre. He entered a house and did not want anyone to know it; yet he could not keep his presence secret. In fact, as soon as she heard about him, a woman whose little daughter was possessed by an impure spirit came and fell at his feet. The woman was a Greek, born in Syrian Phoenicia. She begged Jesus to drive the demon out of her daughter.\n\n\"First let the children eat all they want,\" he told her, \"for it is not right to take the children's bread and toss it to the dogs.\" \"Lord,\" she replied, \"even the dogs under the table eat the children's crumbs.\" Then he told her, \"For such a reply, you may go; the demon has left your daughter.\" She went home and found her child lying on the bed, and the demon gone.\n\nThen Jesus left the vicinity of Tyre and went through Sidon, down to the Sea of Galilee and into the region of the Decapolis. There some people brought to him a man who was deaf and could hardly talk, and they begged Jesus to place his hand on him. After he took him aside, away from the crowd, Jesus put his fingers into the man's ears. Then he spit and touched the man's tongue. He looked up to heaven and with a deep sigh said to him, \"Ephphatha!\" (which means \"Be opened!\"). At this, the man's ears were opened, his tongue was loosened, and he began to speak plainly.\n\nJesus commanded them not to tell anyone. But the more he did so, the more they kept talking about it. People were overwhelmed with amazement. \"He has done everything well,\" they said. \"He even makes the deaf hear and the mute speak.\""}], "temperature": 0, "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"name": "schema", "schema": {"properties": {"translation": {"type": "string"}}, "required": ["translation"], "type": "object"}}}}}

Jesus called his disciples and said to them, \"I feel sorry for the crowd because they have been with me for three days and have nothing to eat. If I send them home hungry, they might faint on the way, and some of them have come from far away.\" His disciples answered him, \"Where can anyone get enough bread to feed them here in this deserted place?\" Jesus asked them, \"How many loaves do you have?\" They said, \"Seven.\" He told the crowd to sit down on the ground. Taking the seven loaves, he gave thanks, broke them, and gave them to his disciples to distribute to the people. They also had a few small fish, and after blessing them, he told the disciples to distribute these as well. The people ate and were satisfied, and they collected seven baskets of leftover pieces. About four thousand people were there, and he sent them away. Immediately, he got into the boat with his disciples and went to the region of Dalmanutha.\n\nThe Pharisees came and began to argue with him, asking for a sign from heaven to test him. Sighing deeply in his spirit, he said, \"Why does this generation ask for a sign? Truly I tell you, no sign will be given to this generation.\" Then he left them, got back into the boat, and went to the other side.\n\nThe disciples had forgotten to bring bread, except for one loaf they had with them in the boat. Jesus warned them, \"Watch out for the yeast of the Pharisees and that of Herod.\" They discussed this with one another and said, \"It is because we have no bread.\" Aware of their discussion, Jesus asked them, \"Why are you talking about having no bread? Do you still not see or understand? Are your hearts hardened? Do you have eyes but fail to see, and ears but fail to hear? And don't you remember? When I broke the five loaves for the five thousand, how many basketfuls of pieces did you pick up?\" \"Twelve,\" they replied. \"And when I broke the seven loaves for the four thousand, how many basketfuls of pieces did you pick up?\" They answered, \"Seven.\" He said to them, \"Do you still not understand?\"\n\nThey came to Bethsaida, and some people brought a blind man to Jesus and begged him to touch him. He took the blind man by the hand and led him outside the village. When he had spit on the man's eyes and put his hands on him, Jesus asked, \"Do you see anything?\" He looked up and said, \"I see people; they look like trees walking around.\" Once more Jesus put his hands on the man's eyes. Then his eyes were opened, his sight was restored, and he saw everything clearly. Jesus sent him home, saying, \"Don't even go into the village.\"\n\nJesus and his disciples went on to the villages around Caesarea Philippi. On the way, he asked them, \"Who do people say I am?\" They replied, \"Some say John the Baptist; others say Elijah; and still others, one of the prophets.\" \"But what about you?\" he asked. \"Who do you say I am?\" Peter answered, \"You are the Messiah.\" Jesus warned them not to tell anyone about him.\n\nHe then began to teach them that the Son of Man must suffer many things and be rejected by the elders, the chief priests, and the teachers of the law, and that he must be killed and after three days rise again. He spoke plainly about this, and Peter took him aside and began to rebuke him. But when Jesus turned and looked at his disciples, he rebuked Peter. \"Get behind me, Satan!\" he said. \"You do not have in mind the concerns of God, but merely human concerns.\"\n\nThen he called the crowd to him along with his disciples and said: \"Whoever wants to be my disciple must deny themselves and take up their cross and follow me. For whoever wants to save their life will lose it, but whoever loses their life for me and for the gospel will save it. What good is it for someone to gain the whole world, yet forfeit their soul?

There, he changed in front of them, and his clothes became dazzling white, whiter than anyone on earth could bleach them. Elijah and Moses appeared and talked with Jesus. Peter said to Jesus, \"Teacher, it's good for us to be here. Let's make three shelters: one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah.\" He didn't know what to say because they were so afraid. Then a cloud covered them, and a voice from the cloud said, \"This is my beloved Son. Listen to him!\" Suddenly, when they looked around, they saw no one except Jesus with them.\n\nAs they were coming down the mountain, Jesus told them not to tell anyone what they had seen until the Son of Man had risen from the dead. They kept this to themselves, wondering what \"rising from the dead\" meant. They asked him, \"Why do the teachers of the law say that Elijah must come first?\" Jesus replied, \"Elijah does come first to restore all things. But why is it written that the Son of Man must suffer and be rejected? But I tell you, Elijah has come, and they did to him whatever they wanted, just as it is written about him.\"\n\nWhen they came to the other disciples, they saw a large crowd around them and the teachers of the law arguing with them. As soon as the crowd saw Jesus, they were amazed and ran to greet him. Jesus asked, \"What are you arguing about?\" A man in the crowd answered, \"Teacher, I brought my son to you. He has a spirit that makes him unable to speak. Whenever it seizes him, it throws him to the ground. He foams at the mouth, grinds his teeth, and becomes rigid. I asked your disciples to drive it out, but they couldn't.\" Jesus replied, \"You unbelieving generation! How long shall I stay with you? How long shall I put up with you? Bring the boy to me.\" So they brought him. When the spirit saw Jesus, it immediately threw the boy into a convulsion. He fell to the ground and rolled around, foaming at the mouth.\n\nJesus asked the boy's father, \"How long has he been like this?\" \"From childhood,\" he answered. \"It has often thrown him into fire or water to kill him. But if you can do anything, take pity on us and help us.\" \"If you can?\" said Jesus. \"Everything is possible for one who believes.\" Immediately the boy's father exclaimed, \"I do believe; help me overcome my unbelief!\" When Jesus saw that a crowd was running to the scene, he rebuked the impure spirit. \"You deaf and mute spirit,\" he said, \"I command you, come out of him and never enter him again.\" The spirit shrieked, convulsed him violently, and came out. The boy looked so much like a corpse that many said, \"He's dead.\" But Jesus took him by the hand and lifted him to his feet, and he stood up.\n\nAfter Jesus had gone indoors, his disciples asked him privately, \"Why couldn't we drive it out?\" He replied, \"This kind can come out only by prayer and fasting.\"\n\nThey left that place and passed through Galilee. Jesus did not want anyone to know where they were because he was teaching his disciples. He said to them, \"The Son of Man is going to be delivered into the hands of men. They will kill him, and after three days he will rise.\" But they did not understand what he meant and were afraid to ask him about it.\n\nThey came to Capernaum. When he was in the house, he asked them, \"What were you arguing about on the road?\" But they kept quiet because on the way they had argued about who was the greatest. Sitting down, Jesus called the Twelve and said, \"Anyone who wants to be first must be the very last, and the servant of all.\" He took a little child whom he placed among them. Taking the child in his arms, he said to them, \"Whoever welcomes one of these little children in my name welcomes me; and whoever welcomes me does not welcome me but the one who sent me.\"\n\n\"Teacher,\" said John, \"we saw someone driving out demons in your name and we told him to stop because he was not one of us.\" \"Do not stop him,\" Jesus said. \"For no one who does a miracle in my name can in the next moment say anything bad about me, for whoever is not against us is for us. Truly I tell you, anyone who gives you a cup of water in my name because you belong to the Messiah will certainly not lose their reward.\"\n\n\"If anyone causes one of these little ones--those who believe in me--to stumble, it would be better for them if a large millstone were hung around their neck and they were thrown into the sea. If your hand causes you to stumble, cut it off. It is better for you to enter life maimed than with two hands to go into hell, where the fire never goes out. And if your foot causes you to stumble, cut it off. It is better for you to enter life crippled than to have two feet and be thrown into hell. And if your eye causes you to stumble, pluck it out. It is better for you to enter the kingdom of God with one eye than to have two eyes and be thrown into hell, where the worms that eat them do not die, and the fire is not quenched. Everyone will be salted with fire. Salt is good, but if it loses its saltiness, how can you make it salty again?

Crowds gathered around him again, and as usual, he taught them. Some Pharisees came to test him by asking if it was lawful for a man to divorce his wife. Jesus asked them what Moses commanded, and they replied that Moses allowed a man to write a certificate of divorce. Jesus explained that Moses wrote this law because of their hard hearts, but from the beginning of creation, God made them male and female. Therefore, a man will leave his parents and be united with his wife, and the two will become one flesh. What God has joined together, let no one separate.\n\nLater, the disciples asked Jesus about this again, and he said that anyone who divorces his wife and marries another woman commits adultery. The same goes for a woman who divorces her husband and marries another man.\n\nPeople were bringing children to Jesus for him to bless them, but the disciples scolded them. Jesus was upset and said, \"Let the children come to me, and do not stop them, for the kingdom of God belongs to such as these. Truly, anyone who does not receive the kingdom of God like a child will never enter it.\" He took the children in his arms, placed his hands on them, and blessed them.\n\nAs Jesus was leaving, a man ran up to him and asked, \"Good teacher, what must I do to inherit eternal life?\" Jesus replied, \"Why do you call me good? No one is good except God alone. You know the commandments: Do not murder, do not commit adultery, do not steal, do not give false testimony, do not defraud, honor your father and mother.\" The man said he had kept all these since he was young. Jesus looked at him with love and said, \"You lack one thing: go, sell everything you have and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come, follow me.\" The man went away sad because he had great wealth.\n\nJesus looked around and said to his disciples, \"How hard it is for the rich to enter the kingdom of God!\" The disciples were amazed at his words. Jesus said again, \"Children, how hard it is to enter the kingdom of God! It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter the kingdom of God.\" The disciples were even more amazed and asked, \"Who then can be saved?\" Jesus looked at them and said, \"With man this is impossible, but not with God; all things are possible with God.\"\n\nPeter spoke up, \"We have left everything to follow you!\" Jesus replied, \"Truly I tell you, no one who has left home or family for me and the gospel will fail to receive a hundred times as much in this present age and in the age to come, eternal life. But many who are first will be last, and the last first.\"\n\nAs they were on their way to Jerusalem, Jesus was leading the way, and the disciples were astonished, while those who followed were afraid. He took the twelve aside and told them what was going to happen to him: \"We are going up to Jerusalem, and the Son of Man will be delivered to the chief priests and teachers of the law. They will condemn him to death and hand him over to the Gentiles, who will mock him, spit on him, flog him, and kill him. Three days later he will rise.\"\n\nThen James and John, the sons of Zebedee, came to him and asked, \"Teacher, we want you to do for us whatever we ask.\" Jesus asked what they wanted, and they said, \"Let one of us sit at your right and the other at your left in your glory.\" Jesus said, \"You don't know what you are asking. Can you drink the cup I drink or be baptized with the baptism I am baptized with?\" They said they could, and Jesus told them they would indeed drink the cup and be baptized with the baptism, but to sit at his right or left was not for him to grant.\n\nWhen the other ten disciples heard about this, they became indignant with James and John. Jesus called them together and said, \"You know that those who are regarded as rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and their high officials exercise authority over them. Not so with you. Instead, whoever wants to become great among you must be your servant, and whoever wants to be first must be the slave of all. For even the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many.\"\n\nAs they were leaving Jericho, a blind man named Bartimaeus was sitting by the roadside begging. When he heard that Jesus of Nazareth was passing by, he began to shout, \"Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!\" Many rebuked him and told him to be quiet, but he shouted all the more, \"Son of David, have mercy on me!\" Jesus stopped and said, \"Call him.\" So they called to the blind man, \"Cheer up! On your feet! He's calling you.\" Throwing his cloak aside, he jumped to his feet and came to Jesus.\n\n\"What do you want me to do for you?\" Jesus asked him. The blind man said, \"Rabbi, I want to see.\" Jesus said, \"Go, your faith has healed you.\" Immediately he received his sight and followed Jesus along the road."}], "temperature": 0, "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"name": "schema", "schema": {"properties": {"translation": {"type": "string"}}, "required": ["translation"], "type": "object"}}}}}

Untie it and bring it here. If anyone asks you why you are doing this, say, 'The Lord needs it and will send it back here shortly.'\" So they went and found the young donkey tied outside in the street and untied it. Some people standing there asked, \"What are you doing, untying that donkey?\" They answered as Jesus had told them to, and the people let them go. They brought the donkey to Jesus, threw their cloaks over it, and he sat on it. Many people spread their cloaks on the road, while others spread branches they had cut in the fields. Those who went ahead and those who followed shouted, \"Hosanna! Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord! Blessed is the coming kingdom of our father David! Hosanna in the highest heaven!\" Jesus entered Jerusalem and went into the temple courts. He looked around at everything, but since it was already late, he went out to Bethany with the Twelve. The next day, as they were leaving Bethany, Jesus was hungry. Seeing in the distance a fig tree in leaf, he went to find out if it had any fruit. When he reached it, he found nothing but leaves, because it was not the season for figs. Then he said to the tree, \"May no one ever eat fruit from you again,\" and his disciples heard him say it. On reaching Jerusalem, Jesus entered the temple courts and began driving out those who were buying and selling there. He overturned the tables of the money changers and the benches of those selling doves and would not allow anyone to carry merchandise through the temple courts. And as he taught them, he said, \"Is it not written: 'My house will be called a house of prayer for all nations'? But you have made it a den of robbers.\" The chief priests and the teachers of the law heard this and began looking for a way to kill him, for they feared him, because the whole crowd was amazed at his teaching. When evening came, Jesus and his disciples went out of the city. In the morning, as they went along, they saw the fig tree withered from the roots. Peter remembered and said to Jesus, \"Rabbi, look! The fig tree you cursed has withered!\" \"Have faith in God,\" Jesus answered. \"Truly I tell you, if anyone says to this mountain, 'Go, throw yourself into the sea,' and does not doubt in their heart but believes that what they say will happen, it will be done for them. Therefore I tell you, whatever you ask for in prayer, believe that you have received it, and it will be yours. And when you stand praying, if you hold anything against anyone, forgive them, so that your Father in heaven may forgive you your sins.\" They arrived again in Jerusalem, and while Jesus was walking in the temple courts, the chief priests, the teachers of the law, and the elders came to him. \"By what authority are you doing these things?\" they asked. \"And who gave you authority to do this?\" Jesus replied, \"I will ask you one question. Answer me, and I will tell you by what authority I am doing these things. John's baptism--was it from heaven, or of human origin? Tell me!\" They discussed it among themselves and said, \"If we say, 'From heaven,' he will ask, 'Then why didn't you believe him?' But if we say, 'Of human origin'...\" (They feared the people, for everyone held that John really was a prophet.)

He said, \"A man planted a vineyard, put a fence around it, dug a pit for the winepress, and built a watchtower. Then he rented it to some farmers and went away. At harvest time, he sent a servant to collect some of the fruit from the farmers. But they beat him and sent him away empty-handed. He sent another servant, and they hit him on the head and treated him shamefully. He sent another, and they killed him. He sent many others; some they beat, others they killed. Finally, he had one left to send, his beloved son. He sent him last, saying, 'They will respect my son.' But the farmers said to each other, 'This is the heir. Let's kill him, and the inheritance will be ours.' So they took him, killed him, and threw him out of the vineyard. What will the owner of the vineyard do? He will come and destroy the farmers and give the vineyard to others. Haven't you read this scripture: 'The stone the builders rejected has become the cornerstone; the Lord has done this, and it is marvelous in our eyes'?\"\n\nThe religious leaders wanted to arrest Jesus because they knew he had told this story against them, but they were afraid of the crowd. So they left him and went away.\n\nLater, they sent some Pharisees and Herodians to trap him with his own words. They came to him and said, \"Teacher, we know you are truthful and don't care about anyone's opinion because you don't look at people's status but teach the way of God truthfully. Is it right to pay taxes to Caesar or not? Should we pay or shouldn't we?\" But Jesus knew their hypocrisy and said, \"Why are you trying to trap me? Bring me a coin and let me look at it.\" They brought the coin, and he asked them, \"Whose image is this, and whose inscription?\" \"Caesar's,\" they replied. Then Jesus said to them, \"Give back to Caesar what is Caesar's and to God what is God's.\" And they were amazed at him.\n\nThen the Sadducees, who say there is no resurrection, came to him with a question. \"Teacher,\" they said, \"Moses wrote for us that if a man's brother dies and leaves a wife but no children, the man must marry the widow and raise up offspring for his brother. There were seven brothers. The first one married and died without leaving any children. The second one married the widow, but he also died, leaving no child. It was the same with the third. In fact, none of the seven left any children. Last of all, the woman died too. At the resurrection, whose wife will she be, since the seven were married to her?\" Jesus replied, \"Are you not in error because you do not know the Scriptures or the power of God? When the dead rise, they will neither marry nor be given in marriage; they will be like the angels in heaven. Now about the dead rising--have you not read in the Book of Moses, in the account of the burning bush, how God said to him, 'I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob'? He is not the God of the dead, but of the living. You are badly mistaken!\"\n\nOne of the teachers of the law came and heard them debating. Noticing that Jesus had given them a good answer, he asked him, \"Of all the commandments, which is the most important?\" \"The most important one,\" answered Jesus, \"is this: 'Hear, O Israel: The Lord our God, the Lord is one. Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind and with all your strength.' The second is this: 'Love your neighbor as yourself.' There is no commandment greater than these.\" \"Well said, teacher,\" the man replied. \"You are right in saying that God is one and there is no other but him. To love him with all your heart, with all your understanding and with all your strength, and to love your neighbor as yourself is more important than all burnt offerings and sacrifices.\" When Jesus saw that he had answered wisely, he said to him, \"You are not far from the kingdom of God.\" And from then on, no one dared ask him any more questions.\n\nWhile Jesus was teaching in the temple courts, he asked, \"Why do the teachers of the law say that the Messiah is the son of David? David himself, speaking by the Holy Spirit, declared: 'The Lord said to my Lord: \"Sit at my right hand until I put your enemies under your feet.\"' David himself calls him 'Lord.' How then can he be his son?\" The large crowd listened to him with delight.\n\nAs he taught, Jesus said, \"Watch out for the teachers of the law. They like to walk around in flowing robes and be greeted with respect in the marketplaces, and have the most important seats in the synagogues and the places of honor at banquets. They devour widows' houses and for a show make lengthy prayers. These men will be punished most severely.\"\n\nJesus sat down opposite the place where the offerings were put and watched the crowd putting their money into the temple treasury. Many rich people threw in large amounts. But a poor widow came and put in two very small copper coins, worth only a few cents. Calling his disciples to him, Jesus said, \"Truly I tell you, this poor widow has put more into the treasury than all the others. They all gave out of their wealth; but she, out of her poverty, put in everything--all she had to live on.\""}], "temperature": 0, "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"name": "schema", "schema": {"properties": {"translation": {"type": "string"}}, "required": ["translation"], "type": "object"}}}}}

Not one stone will be left on another; every one will be thrown down.\" While he was sitting on the Mount of Olives opposite the temple, Peter, James, John, and Andrew asked him privately, \"Tell us, when will these things happen? And what will be the sign that they are about to be fulfilled?\" Jesus began to say to them, \"Watch out that no one deceives you. Many will come in my name, claiming, 'I am he,' and will deceive many. When you hear of wars and rumors of wars, do not be alarmed. Such things must happen, but the end is still to come. Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. There will be earthquakes in various places, and famines. These are the beginning of birth pains. Be on your guard. You will be handed over to the local councils and flogged in the synagogues. On account of me, you will stand before governors and kings as witnesses to them. And the gospel must first be preached to all nations. Whenever you are arrested and brought to trial, do not worry beforehand about what to say. Just say whatever is given you at the time, for it is not you speaking, but the Holy Spirit. Brother will betray brother to death, and a father his child. Children will rebel against their parents and have them put to death. Everyone will hate you because of me, but the one who stands firm to the end will be saved. When you see 'the abomination that causes desolation' standing where it does not belong--let the reader understand--then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains. Let no one on the housetop go down or enter the house to take anything out. Let no one in the field go back to get their cloak. How dreadful it will be in those days for pregnant women and nursing mothers! Pray that this will not take place in winter, because those will be days of distress unequaled from the beginning, when God created the world, until now--and never to be equaled again. If the Lord had not cut short those days, no one would survive. But for the sake of the elect, whom he has chosen, he has shortened them. At that time if anyone says to you, 'Look, here is the Messiah!' or, 'Look, there he is!' do not believe it. For false messiahs and false prophets will appear and perform signs and wonders to deceive, if possible, even the elect. So be on your guard; I have told you everything ahead of time. But in those days, following that distress, 'the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light; the stars will fall from the sky, and the heavenly bodies will be shaken.' At that time people will see the Son of Man coming in clouds with great power and glory. And he will send his angels and gather his elect from the four winds, from the ends of the earth to the ends of the heavens. Now learn this lesson from the fig tree: As soon as its twigs get tender and its leaves come out, you know that summer is near. Even so, when you see these things happening, you know that it is near, right at the door. Truly I tell you, this generation will certainly not pass away until all these things have happened. Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will never pass away. But about that day or hour no one knows, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father. Be on guard! Be alert! You do not know when that time will come. It's like a man going away: He leaves his house and puts his servants in charge, each with their assigned task, and tells the one at the door to keep watch. Therefore keep watch because you do not know when the owner of the house will come back--whether in the evening, or at midnight, or when the rooster crows, or at dawn. If he comes suddenly, do not let him find you sleeping.

She broke the jar and poured the perfume on his head. Some of those present were saying indignantly to one another, \"Why this waste of perfume? It could have been sold for more than a year's wages and the money given to the poor.\" And they rebuked her harshly.\n\n\"Leave her alone,\" said Jesus. \"Why are you bothering her? She has done a beautiful thing to me. The poor you will always have with you, and you can help them any time you want. But you will not always have me. She did what she could. She poured perfume on my body beforehand to prepare for my burial.

They were delighted to hear this and promised to give him money. So he watched for an opportunity to hand him over.\n\nOn the first day of the Festival of Unleavened Bread, when it was customary to sacrifice the Passover lamb, Jesus' disciples asked him, \"Where do you want us to go and make preparations for you to eat the Passover?\"\n\nSo he sent two of his disciples, telling them, \"Go into the city, and a man carrying a jar of water will meet you. Follow him. Say to the owner of the house he enters, 'The Teacher asks: Where is my guest room, where I may eat the Passover with my disciples?' He will show you a large room upstairs, furnished and ready. Make preparations for us there.\"\n\nThe disciples left, went into the city and found things just as Jesus had told them. So they prepared the Passover.\n\nWhen evening came, Jesus arrived with the Twelve. While they were reclining at the table eating, he said, \"Truly I tell you, one of you will betray me--one who is eating with me.\"\n\nThey were saddened, and one by one they said to him, \"Surely you don't mean me?\"\n\n\"It is one of the Twelve,\" he replied, \"one who dips bread into the bowl with me. The Son of Man will go just as it is written about him. But woe to that man who betrays the Son of Man! It would be better for him if he had not been born.\"\n\nWhile they were eating, Jesus took bread, and when he had given thanks, he broke it and gave it to his disciples, saying, \"Take it; this is my body.\"\n\nThen he took a cup, and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and they all drank from it.\n\n\"This is my blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many,\" he said to them. \"Truly I tell you, I will not drink again from the fruit of the vine until that day when I drink it new in the kingdom of God.\"\n\nWhen they had sung a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives.\n\n\"You will all fall away,\" Jesus told them, \"for it is written: 'I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep will be scattered.' But after I have risen, I will go ahead of you into Galilee.\"\n\nPeter declared, \"Even if all fall away, I will not.\"\n\n\"Truly I tell you,\" Jesus answered, \"today--yes, tonight--before the rooster crows twice you yourself will disown me three times.\"\n\nBut Peter insisted emphatically, \"Even if I have to die with you, I will never disown you.\" And all the others said the same.\n\nThey went to a place called Gethsemane, and Jesus said to his disciples, \"Sit here while I pray.\" He took Peter, James and John along with him, and he began to be deeply distressed and troubled.\n\n\"My soul is overwhelmed with sorrow to the point of death,\" he said to them. \"Stay here and keep watch.\"\n\nGoing a little farther, he fell to the ground and prayed that if possible the hour might pass from him. \"Abba, Father,\" he said, \"everything is possible for you. Take this cup from me. Yet not what I will, but what you will.\"\n\nThen he returned to his disciples and found them sleeping. \"Simon,\" he said to Peter, \"are you asleep? Couldn't you keep watch for one hour? Watch and pray so that you will not fall into temptation. The spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak.\"\n\nOnce more he went away and prayed the same thing. When he came back, he again found them sleeping, because their eyes were heavy. They did not know what to say to him.\n\nReturning the third time, he said to them, \"Are you still sleeping and resting? Enough! The hour has come. Look, the Son of Man is delivered into the hands of sinners. Rise! Let us go! Here comes my betrayer!\"\n\nJust as he was speaking, Judas, one of the Twelve, appeared. With him was a crowd armed with swords and clubs, sent from the chief priests, the teachers of the law, and the elders. Now the betrayer had arranged a signal with them: \"The one I kiss is the man; arrest him and lead him away under guard.\"\n\nGoing at once to Jesus, Judas said, \"Rabbi!\" and kissed him. The men seized Jesus and arrested him. Then one of those standing near drew his sword and struck the servant of the high priest, cutting off his ear.\n\n\"Am I leading a rebellion,\" said Jesus, \"that you have come out with swords and clubs to capture me? Every day I was with you, teaching in the temple courts, and you did not arrest me. But the Scriptures must be fulfilled.\"\n\nThen everyone deserted him and fled.\n\nA young man, wearing nothing but a linen garment, was following Jesus. When they seized him, he fled naked, leaving his garment behind.\n\nThey took Jesus to the high priest, and all the chief priests, the elders and the teachers of the law came together. Peter followed him at a distance, right into the courtyard of the high priest. There he sat with the guards and warmed himself at the fire.\n\nThe chief priests and the whole Sanhedrin were looking for evidence against Jesus so that they could put him to death, but they did not find any. Many testified falsely against him, but their statements did not agree.\n\nThen some stood up and gave this false testimony against him: \"We heard him say, 'I will destroy this temple made with human hands and in three days will build another, not made with hands.'\" Yet even then their testimony did not agree.\n\nThen the high priest stood up before them and asked Jesus, \"Are you not going to answer? What is this testimony that these men are bringing against you?\" But Jesus remained silent and gave no answer.\n\nAgain the high priest asked him, \"Are you the Messiah, the Son of the Blessed One?\"\n\n\"I am,\" said Jesus. \"And you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Mighty One and coming on the clouds of heaven.\"\n\nThe high priest tore his clothes. \"Why do we need any more witnesses?\" he asked. \"You have heard the blasphemy. What do you think?\"\n\nThey all condemned him as worthy of death. Then some began to spit at him; they blindfolded him, struck him with their fists, and said, \"Prophesy!\" And the guards took him and beat him.\n\nWhile Peter was below in the courtyard, one of the servant girls of the high priest came by. When she saw Peter warming himself, she looked closely at him.\n\n\"You also were with that Nazarene, Jesus,\" she said.\n\nBut he denied it. \"I don't know or understand what you're talking about,\" he said, and went out into the entryway.\n\nWhen the servant girl saw him there, she said again to those standing around, \"This fellow is one of them.\" Again he denied it.\n\nAfter a little while, those standing near said to Peter, \"Surely you are one of them, for you are a Galilean.\"\n\nHe began to call down curses, and he swore to them, \"I don't know this man you're talking about.\"\n\nImmediately the rooster crowed the second time. Then Peter remembered the word Jesus had spoken to him: \"Before the rooster crows twice you will disown me three times.\" And he broke down and wept."}], "temperature": 0, "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"name": "schema", "schema": {"properties": {"translation": {"type": "string"}}, "required": ["translation"], "type": "object"}}}}}

They tied up Jesus and took him to Pilate. Pilate asked him, \"Are you the King of the Jews?\" Jesus replied, \"You say so.\" The chief priests accused him of many things, but Jesus did not answer, which surprised Pilate.\n\nDuring the festival, Pilate would release a prisoner chosen by the people. There was a man named Barabbas, who was in prison with rebels who had committed murder. The crowd asked Pilate to release a prisoner as usual. Pilate asked, \"Do you want me to release the King of the Jews?\" He knew the chief priests had handed Jesus over out of envy. But the chief priests stirred up the crowd to ask for Barabbas instead.\n\nPilate asked, \"What should I do with the one you call the King of the Jews?\" They shouted, \"Crucify him!\" Pilate asked, \"Why? What crime has he committed?\" But they shouted even louder, \"Crucify him!\" Wanting to satisfy the crowd, Pilate released Barabbas and handed Jesus over to be crucified.\n\nThe soldiers took Jesus into the courtyard, called the Praetorium, and gathered the whole company of soldiers. They dressed him in a purple robe, twisted a crown of thorns, and put it on his head. They mocked him, saying, \"Hail, King of the Jews!\" They hit him on the head with a staff, spit on him, and knelt in mock worship. After mocking him, they took off the purple robe and put his own clothes back on him. Then they led him out to crucify him.\n\nThey forced a man named Simon from Cyrene, who was coming in from the country, to carry Jesus' cross. They brought Jesus to a place called Golgotha, which means \"Place of the Skull.\" They offered him wine mixed with myrrh, but he did not take it. They crucified him and divided his clothes by casting lots to see what each would get. It was nine in the morning when they crucified him. The written charge against him read: THE KING OF THE JEWS.\n\nThey crucified two rebels with him, one on his right and one on his left. Those who passed by hurled insults at him, shaking their heads and saying, \"So! You who are going to destroy the temple and build it in three days, come down from the cross and save yourself!\" In the same way, the chief priests and teachers of the law mocked him among themselves, saying, \"He saved others, but he can't save himself! Let this Messiah, this King of Israel, come down now from the cross, that we may see and believe.\" Those crucified with him also heaped insults on him.\n\nAt noon, darkness came over the whole land until three in the afternoon. At three in the afternoon, Jesus cried out in a loud voice, \"Eloi, Eloi, lema sabachthani?\" (which means \"My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?\") Some of those standing near heard this and said, \"Listen, he's calling Elijah.\" Someone ran, filled a sponge with wine vinegar, put it on a staff, and offered it to Jesus to drink. \"Leave him alone. Let's see if Elijah comes to take him down,\" he said. With a loud cry, Jesus breathed his last.\n\nThe curtain of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom. And when the centurion, who stood there in front of Jesus, saw how he died, he said, \"Surely this man was the Son of God!\"\n\nSome women were watching from a distance. Among them were Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James the younger and of Joseph, and Salome. In Galilee, these women had followed him and cared for his needs. Many other women who had come up with him to Jerusalem were also there.\n\nIt was Preparation Day (that is, the day before the Sabbath). So as evening approached, Joseph of Arimathea, a prominent member of the Council, who was himself waiting for the kingdom of God, went boldly to Pilate and asked for Jesus' body. Pilate was surprised to hear that he was already dead. Summoning the centurion, he asked him if Jesus had already died. When he learned from the centurion that it was so, he gave the body to Joseph.\n\nSo Joseph bought some linen cloth, took down the body, wrapped it in the linen, and placed it in a tomb cut out of rock. Then he rolled a stone against the entrance of the tomb. Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joseph saw where he was laid."}], "temperature": 0, "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"name": "schema", "schema": {"properties": {"translation": {"type": "string"}}, "required": ["translation"], "type": "object"}}}}}

But when they looked up, they saw that the stone, which was very large, had already been rolled away. As they entered the tomb, they saw a young man dressed in a white robe sitting on the right side, and they were alarmed.\n\n\"Don't be alarmed,\" he said. \"You are looking for Jesus the Nazarene, who was crucified. He has risen! He is not here. See the place where they laid him. But go, tell his disciples and Peter, 'He is going ahead of you into Galilee. There you will see him, just as he told you.'\"\n\nTrembling and bewildered, the women went out and fled from the tomb. They said nothing to anyone because they were afraid.\n\nWhen Jesus rose early on the first day of the week, he appeared first to Mary Magdalene, out of whom he had driven seven demons. She went and told those who had been with him and who were mourning and weeping. When they heard that Jesus was alive and that she had seen him, they did not believe it.\n\nAfterward, Jesus appeared in a different form to two of them while they were walking in the country. These returned and reported it to the rest, but they did not believe them either.\n\nLater, Jesus appeared to the Eleven as they were eating; he rebuked them for their lack of faith and their stubborn refusal to believe those who had seen him after he had risen.\n\nHe said to them, \"Go into all the world and preach the gospel to all creation. Whoever believes and is baptized will be saved, but whoever does not believe will be condemned.

Because Joseph, her husband, was faithful to the law and did not want to expose her to public disgrace, he had in mind to divorce her quietly. But after he had considered this, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream and said, \"Joseph son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary home as your wife, because what is conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit. She will give birth to a son, and you are to give him the name Jesus, because he will save his people from their sins.\" All this took place to fulfill what the Lord had said through the prophet: \"The virgin will conceive and give birth to a son, and they will call him Immanuel\" (which means \"God with us\"). When Joseph woke up, he did what the angel of the Lord had commanded him and took Mary home as his wife. But he did not consummate their marriage until she gave birth to a son.

He gathered all the chief priests and scribes of the people and asked them where the Christ was to be born. They told him, \"In Bethlehem of Judea, for this is what the prophet wrote: 'And you, Bethlehem, in the land of Judah, are by no means least among the rulers of Judah; for out of you will come a ruler who will shepherd my people Israel.'\"\n\nThen Herod secretly called the wise men and found out from them the exact time the star had appeared. He sent them to Bethlehem and said, \"Go and search carefully for the child. When you find him, report back to me so that I too may go and worship him.\" After hearing the king, they went on their way, and the star they had seen in the East went ahead of them until it stopped over the place where the child was. When they saw the star, they were overjoyed. They went into the house and saw the child with Mary, his mother, and they bowed down and worshiped him. They opened their treasures and presented him with gifts of gold, frankincense, and myrrh.\n\nHaving been warned in a dream not to return to Herod, they went back to their country by another route. After they had left, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream and said, \"Get up, take the child and his mother, and escape to Egypt. Stay there until I tell you, for Herod is going to search for the child to kill him.\" So Joseph got up, took the child and his mother during the night, and left for Egypt, where they stayed until the death of Herod. This fulfilled what the Lord had said through the prophet: \"Out of Egypt I called my son.\"\n\nWhen Herod realized that he had been outwitted by the wise men, he was furious, and he ordered the killing of all the boys in Bethlehem and its vicinity who were two years old and under, according to the time he had learned from the wise men.

But when he heard that Archelaus was reigning in Judea in place of his father Herod, he was afraid to go there.

His disciples came to him, and he began to teach them, saying:\n\n\"Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. Blessed are those who mourn, for they will be comforted. Blessed are the meek, for they will inherit the earth. Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they will be filled. Blessed are the merciful, for they will be shown mercy. Blessed are the pure in heart, for they will see God. Blessed are the peacemakers, for they will be called children of God. Blessed are those who are persecuted because of righteousness, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. Blessed are you when people insult you, persecute you, and falsely say all kinds of evil against you because of me. Rejoice and be glad, because great is your reward in heaven, for in the same way they persecuted the prophets who were before you.\n\nYou are the salt of the earth. But if the salt loses its saltiness, how can it be made salty again? It is no longer good for anything, except to be thrown out and trampled underfoot. You are the light of the world. A town built on a hill cannot be hidden. Neither do people light a lamp and put it under a bowl. Instead, they put it on its stand, and it gives light to everyone in the house. In the same way, let your light shine before others, that they may see your good deeds and glorify your Father in heaven.\n\nDo not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them. For truly I tell you, until heaven and earth disappear, not the smallest letter, not the least stroke of a pen, will by any means disappear from the Law until everything is accomplished. Therefore, anyone who sets aside one of the least of these commands and teaches others accordingly will be called least in the kingdom of heaven, but whoever practices and teaches these commands will be called great in the kingdom of heaven. For I tell you that unless your righteousness surpasses that of the Pharisees and the teachers of the law, you will certainly not enter the kingdom of heaven.\n\nYou have heard that it was said to the people long ago, 'You shall not murder, and anyone who murders will be subject to judgment.' But I tell you that anyone who is angry with a brother or sister will be subject to judgment. Again, anyone who says to a brother or sister, 'Raca,' is answerable to the court. And anyone who says, 'You fool!' will be in danger of the fire of hell.\n\nTherefore, if you are offering your gift at the altar and there remember that your brother or sister has something against you, leave your gift there in front of the altar. First go and be reconciled to them; then come and offer your gift.\n\nSettle matters quickly with your adversary who is taking you to court. Do it while you are still together on the way, or your adversary may hand you over to the judge, and the judge may hand you over to the officer, and you may be thrown into prison. Truly I tell you, you will not get out until you have paid the last penny.\n\nYou have heard that it was said, 'You shall not commit adultery.' But I tell you that anyone who looks at a woman lustfully has already committed adultery with her in his heart. If your right eye causes you to stumble, gouge it out and throw it away. It is better for you to lose one part of your body than for your whole body to be thrown into hell. And if your right hand causes you to stumble, cut it off and throw it away. It is better for you to lose one part of your body than for your whole body to go into hell.\n\nIt has been said, 'Anyone who divorces his wife must give her a certificate of divorce.' But I tell you that anyone who divorces his wife, except for sexual immorality, makes her the victim of adultery, and anyone who marries a divorced woman commits adultery.\n\nAgain, you have heard that it was said to the people long ago, 'Do not break your oath, but fulfill to the Lord the vows you have made.' But I tell you, do not swear an oath at all: either by heaven, for it is God's throne; or by the earth, for it is his footstool; or by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the Great King. And do not swear by your head, for you cannot make even one hair white or black. All you need to say is simply 'Yes' or 'No'; anything beyond this comes from the evil one.\n\nYou have heard that it was said, 'Eye for eye, and tooth for tooth.' But I tell you, do not resist an evil person. If anyone slaps you on the right cheek, turn to them the other cheek also. And if anyone wants to sue you and take your shirt, hand over your coat as well. If anyone forces you to go one mile, go with them two miles. Give to the one who asks you, and do not turn away from the one who wants to borrow from you.\n\nYou have heard that it was said, 'Love your neighbor and hate your enemy.' But I tell you, love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you, that you may be children of your Father in heaven. He causes his sun to rise on the evil and the good, and sends rain on the righteous and the unrighteous. If you love those who love you, what reward will you get?

If you do, you won't get any reward from your Father in heaven. So when you give to the needy, don't announce it with trumpets like the hypocrites do in the synagogues and on the streets to be honored by others. Truly I tell you, they have received their reward in full. But when you give to the needy, don't let your left hand know what your right hand is doing, so that your giving may be in secret. Then your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you.\n\nAnd when you pray, don't be like the hypocrites, for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and on the street corners to be seen by others. Truly I tell you, they have received their reward in full. But when you pray, go into your room, close the door and pray to your Father, who is unseen. Then your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you.\n\nAnd when you pray, don't keep on babbling like pagans, for they think they will be heard because of their many words. Don't be like them, for your Father knows what you need before you ask him. This, then, is how you should pray:\n\n\"Our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name, your kingdom come, your will be done, on earth as it is in heaven. Give us today our daily bread. And forgive us our debts, as we also have forgiven our debtors. And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from the evil one.\"\n\nFor if you forgive other people when they sin against you, your heavenly Father will also forgive you. But if you do not forgive others their sins, your Father will not forgive your sins.\n\nWhen you fast, don't look somber as the hypocrites do, for they disfigure their faces to show others they are fasting. Truly I tell you, they have received their reward in full. But when you fast, put oil on your head and wash your face, so that it will not be obvious to others that you are fasting, but only to your Father, who is unseen; and your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you.\n\nDo not store up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moths and vermin destroy, and where thieves break in and steal. But store up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where moths and vermin do not destroy, and where thieves do not break in and steal. For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.\n\nThe eye is the lamp of the body. If your eyes are healthy, your whole body will be full of light. But if your eyes are unhealthy, your whole body will be full of darkness. If then the light within you is darkness, how great is that darkness!\n\nNo one can serve two masters. Either you will hate the one and love the other, or you will be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve both God and money.\n\nTherefore I tell you, do not worry about your life, what you will eat or drink; or about your body, what you will wear. Is not life more than food, and the body more than clothes? Look at the birds of the air; they do not sow or reap or store away in barns, and yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not much more valuable than they?\n\nCan any one of you by worrying add a single hour to your life?\n\nAnd why do you worry about clothes? See how the flowers of the field grow. They do not labor or spin. Yet I tell you that not even Solomon in all his splendor was dressed like one of these. If that is how God clothes the grass of the field, which is here today and tomorrow is thrown into the fire, will he not much more clothe you--you of little faith?\n\nSo do not worry, saying, \"What shall we eat?\" or \"What shall we drink?\" or \"What shall we wear?\" For the pagans run after all these things, and your heavenly Father knows that you need them. But seek first his kingdom and his righteousness, and all these things will be given to you as well.\n\nTherefore do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about itself.

Jesus told him, \"See that you don't tell anyone, but go, show yourself to the priest and offer the gift Moses commanded, as a testimony to them.\"\n\nWhen Jesus entered Capernaum, a centurion came to him, asking for help. \"Lord,\" he said, \"my servant lies at home paralyzed, suffering terribly.\" Jesus said to him, \"Shall I come and heal him?\" The centurion replied, \"Lord, I do not deserve to have you come under my roof. But just say the word, and my servant will be healed. For I myself am a man under authority, with soldiers under me. I tell this one, 'Go,' and he goes; and that one, 'Come,' and he comes. I say to my servant, 'Do this,' and he does it.\" When Jesus heard this, he was amazed and said to those following him, \"Truly I tell you, I have not found anyone in Israel with such great faith. I say to you that many will come from the east and the west, and will take their places at the feast with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven. But the subjects of the kingdom will be thrown outside, into the darkness, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.\" Then Jesus said to the centurion, \"Go! Let it be done just as you believed it would.\" And his servant was healed at that moment.\n\nWhen Jesus came into Peter's house, he saw Peter's mother-in-law lying in bed with a fever. He touched her hand and the fever left her, and she got up and began to wait on him. When evening came, many who were demon-possessed were brought to him, and he drove out the spirits with a word and healed all the sick. This was to fulfill what was spoken through the prophet Isaiah: \"He took up our infirmities and bore our diseases.\"\n\nWhen Jesus saw the crowd around him, he gave orders to cross to the other side of the lake. Then a teacher of the law came to him and said, \"Teacher, I will follow you wherever you go.\" Jesus replied, \"Foxes have dens and birds have nests, but the Son of Man has no place to lay his head.\" Another disciple said to him, \"Lord, first let me go and bury my father.\" But Jesus told him, \"Follow me, and let the dead bury their own dead.\"\n\nThen he got into the boat and his disciples followed him. Suddenly a furious storm came up on the lake, so that the waves swept over the boat. But Jesus was sleeping. The disciples went and woke him, saying, \"Lord, save us! We're going to drown!\" He replied, \"You of little faith, why are you so afraid?\" Then he got up and rebuked the winds and the waves, and it was completely calm. The men were amazed and asked, \"What kind of man is this? Even the winds and the waves obey him!\"\n\nWhen he arrived at the other side in the region of the Gadarenes, two demon-possessed men coming from the tombs met him. They were so violent that no one could pass that way. \"What do you want with us, Son of God?\" they shouted. \"Have you come here to torture us before the appointed time?\" Some distance from them a large herd of pigs was feeding. The demons begged Jesus, \"If you drive us out, send us into the herd of pigs.\" He said to them, \"Go!\" So they came out and went into the pigs, and the whole herd rushed down the steep bank into the lake and died in the water. Those tending the pigs ran off, went into the town and reported all this, including what had happened to the demon-possessed men. Then the whole town went out to meet Jesus.

Which is easier: to say, 'Your sins are forgiven,' or to say, 'Get up and walk'? But to show you that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins...\" Then he said to the paralyzed man, \"Get up, take your mat and go home.\" And the man got up and went home. When the crowd saw this, they were filled with awe and praised God, who had given such authority to men.\n\nAs Jesus went on from there, he saw a man named Matthew sitting at the tax collector's booth. \"Follow me,\" he told him, and Matthew got up and followed him. While Jesus was having dinner at Matthew's house, many tax collectors and sinners came and ate with him and his disciples. When the Pharisees saw this, they asked his disciples, \"Why does your teacher eat with tax collectors and sinners?\" On hearing this, Jesus said, \"It is not the healthy who need a doctor, but the sick. But go and learn what this means: 'I desire mercy, not sacrifice.' For I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners.\"\n\nThen John's disciples came and asked him, \"How is it that we and the Pharisees fast often, but your disciples do not fast?\" Jesus answered, \"How can the guests of the bridegroom mourn while he is with them? The time will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them; then they will fast. No one sews a patch of unshrunk cloth on an old garment, for the patch will pull away from the garment, making the tear worse. Neither do people pour new wine into old wineskins. If they do, the skins will burst; the wine will run out and the wineskins will be ruined. No, they pour new wine into new wineskins, and both are preserved.\"\n\nWhile he was saying this, a synagogue leader came and knelt before him and said, \"My daughter has just died. But come and put your hand on her, and she will live.\" Jesus got up and went with him, and so did his disciples. Just then a woman who had been subject to bleeding for twelve years came up behind him and touched the edge of his cloak. She said to herself, \"If I only touch his cloak, I will be healed.\" Jesus turned and saw her. \"Take heart, daughter,\" he said, \"your faith has healed you.\" And the woman was healed at that moment.\n\nWhen Jesus entered the synagogue leader's house and saw the noisy crowd and people playing pipes, he said, \"Go away. The girl is not dead but asleep.\" But they laughed at him. After the crowd had been put outside, he went in and took the girl by the hand, and she got up. News of this spread through all that region.\n\nAs Jesus went on from there, two blind men followed him, calling out, \"Have mercy on us, Son of David!\" When he had gone indoors, the blind men came to him, and he asked them, \"Do you believe that I am able to do this?\" \"Yes, Lord,\" they replied. Then he touched their eyes and said, \"According to your faith let it be done to you\"; and their sight was restored. Jesus warned them sternly, \"See that no one knows about this.\" But they went out and spread the news about him all over that region.\n\nWhile they were going out, a man who was demon-possessed and could not talk was brought to Jesus. And when the demon was driven out, the man who had been mute spoke. The crowd was amazed and said, \"Nothing like this has ever been seen in Israel.\" But the Pharisees said, \"It is by the prince of demons that he drives out demons.\"\n\nJesus went through all the towns and villages, teaching in their synagogues, proclaiming the good news of the kingdom and healing every disease and sickness. When he saw the crowds, he had compassion on them, because they were harassed and helpless, like sheep without a shepherd.

Instead, go to the lost sheep of Israel. As you go, proclaim this message: 'The kingdom of heaven has come near.' Heal the sick, raise the dead, cleanse those who have leprosy, drive out demons.

As you enter the home, give it your greeting. If the home is deserving, let your peace rest on it; if it is not, let your peace return to you. If anyone will not welcome you or listen to your words, leave that home or town and shake the dust off your feet. Truly I tell you, it will be more bearable for Sodom and Gomorrah on the day of judgment than for that town.\n\n\"I am sending you out like sheep among wolves. Therefore be as shrewd as snakes and as innocent as doves. Be on your guard; you will be handed over to the local councils and be flogged in the synagogues. On my account, you will be brought before governors and kings as witnesses to them and to the Gentiles. But when they arrest you, do not worry about what to say or how to say it. At that time you will be given what to say, for it will not be you speaking, but the Spirit of your Father speaking through you.\n\n\"Brother will betray brother to death, and a father his child; children will rebel against their parents and have them put to death. You will be hated by everyone because of me, but the one who stands firm to the end will be saved. When you are persecuted in one place, flee to another. Truly I tell you, you will not finish going through the towns of Israel before the Son of Man comes.\n\n\"The student is not above the teacher, nor a servant above his master. It is enough for students to be like their teachers, and servants like their masters. If the head of the house has been called Beelzebul, how much more the members of his household!

What I tell you in the dark, speak in the daylight; what is whispered in your ear, proclaim from the roofs.\n\n\"Do not be afraid of those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul. Rather, be afraid of the One who can destroy both soul and body in hell. Are not two sparrows sold for a penny? Yet not one of them will fall to the ground outside your Father's care. And even the very hairs of your head are all numbered. So don't be afraid; you are worth more than many sparrows.\n\n\"Whoever acknowledges me before others, I will also acknowledge before my Father in heaven.

Blessed is anyone who does not stumble on account of me.\"\n\nAs John's disciples were leaving, Jesus began to speak to the crowd about John: \"What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed swayed by the wind? If not, what did you go out to see? A man dressed in fine clothes? No, those who wear fine clothes are in kings' palaces. Then what did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, and more than a prophet. This is the one about whom it is written: 'I will send my messenger ahead of you, who will prepare your way before you.' Truly I tell you, among those born of women there has not risen anyone greater than John the Baptist; yet whoever is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he. From the days of John the Baptist until now, the kingdom of heaven has been subjected to violence, and violent people have been raiding it. For all the Prophets and the Law prophesied until John. And if you are willing to accept it, he is the Elijah who was to come. Whoever has ears, let them hear.\n\n\"To what can I compare this generation? They are like children sitting in the marketplaces and calling out to others: 'We played the pipe for you, and you did not dance; we sang a dirge, and you did not mourn.' For John came neither eating nor drinking, and they say, 'He has a demon.' The Son of Man came eating and drinking, and they say, 'Here is a glutton and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners.' But wisdom is proved right by her deeds.\"\n\nThen Jesus began to denounce the towns in which most of his miracles had been performed, because they did not repent. \"Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the miracles that were performed in you had been performed in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes.

For if the miracles that were performed in you had been performed in Sodom, it would have remained to this day. But I tell you that it will be more bearable for Sodom on the day of judgment than for you.\"\n\nAt that time Jesus said, \"I praise you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because you have hidden these things from the wise and learned, and revealed them to little children. Yes, Father, for this is what you were pleased to do. All things have been committed to me by my Father. No one knows the Son except the Father, and no one knows the Father except the Son and those to whom the Son chooses to reveal him.\n\n\"Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest.

They began to pick some heads of grain and eat them. When the Pharisees saw this, they said to him, \"Look, your disciples are doing what is not lawful on the Sabbath.\" But he said to them, \"Haven't you read what David did when he and his companions were hungry? He entered the house of God, and he and his companions ate the consecrated bread, which was not lawful for them to do, but only for the priests. Or haven't you read in the Law that on the Sabbath the priests in the temple desecrate the day and yet are innocent? I tell you that something greater than the temple is here. If you had known what these words mean, 'I desire mercy, not sacrifice,' you would not have condemned the innocent. For the Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath.\"\n\nThen Jesus went into their synagogue, and a man with a shriveled hand was there. Looking for a reason to accuse Jesus, they asked him, \"Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath?\" He said to them, \"If any of you has a sheep and it falls into a pit on the Sabbath, will you not take hold of it and lift it out? How much more valuable is a person than a sheep! Therefore it is lawful to do good on the Sabbath.\" Then he said to the man, \"Stretch out your hand.\" So he stretched it out and it was completely restored, just as sound as the other. But the Pharisees went out and plotted how they might kill Jesus.\n\nAware of this, Jesus withdrew from that place. A large crowd followed him, and he healed all who were ill. He warned them not to tell others about him. This was to fulfill what was spoken through the prophet Isaiah: \"Here is my servant whom I have chosen, the one I love, in whom I delight; I will put my Spirit on him, and he will proclaim justice to the nations. He will not quarrel or cry out; no one will hear his voice in the streets. A bruised reed he will not break, and a smoldering wick he will not snuff out, till he has brought justice through to victory. In his name the nations will put their hope.\"\n\nThen they brought him a demon-possessed man who was blind and mute, and Jesus healed him, so that he could both talk and see. All the people were astonished and said, \"Could this be the Son of David?\" But when the Pharisees heard this, they said, \"It is only by Beelzebul, the prince of demons, that this fellow drives out demons.\" Jesus knew their thoughts and said to them, \"Every kingdom divided against itself will be ruined, and every city or household divided against itself will not stand. If Satan drives out Satan, he is divided against himself. How then can his kingdom stand? And if I drive out demons by Beelzebul, by whom do your people drive them out? So then, they will be your judges. But if it is by the Spirit of God that I drive out demons, then the kingdom of God has come upon you.\n\nOr again, how can anyone enter a strong man's house and carry off his possessions unless he first ties up the strong man? Then he can plunder his house. Whoever is not with me is against me, and whoever does not gather with me scatters. And so I tell you, every kind of sin and slander can be forgiven, but blasphemy against the Spirit will not be forgiven. Anyone who speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven, but anyone who speaks against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven, either in this age or in the age to come.\n\nMake a tree good and its fruit will be good, or make a tree bad and its fruit will be bad, for a tree is recognized by its fruit. You brood of vipers, how can you who are evil say anything good? For the mouth speaks what the heart is full of. A good man brings good things out of the good stored up in him, and an evil man brings evil things out of the evil stored up in him. But I tell you that everyone will have to give account on the day of judgment for every empty word they have spoken. For by your words you will be acquitted, and by your words you will be condemned.\"\n\nThen some of the Pharisees and teachers of the law said to him, \"Teacher, we want to see a sign from you.\" He answered, \"A wicked and adulterous generation asks for a sign! But none will be given it except the sign of the prophet Jonah. For as Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of a huge fish, so the Son of Man will be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth. The men of Nineveh will stand up at the judgment with this generation and condemn it; for they repented at the preaching of Jonah, and now something greater than Jonah is here. The Queen of the South will rise at the judgment with this generation and condemn it; for she came from the ends of the earth to listen to Solomon's wisdom, and now something greater than Solomon is here.\n\nWhen an impure spirit comes out of a person, it goes through arid places seeking rest and does not find it. Then it says, 'I will return to the house I left.' When it arrives, it finds the house unoccupied, swept clean and put in order. Then it goes and takes with it seven other spirits more wicked than itself, and they go in and live there. And the final condition of that person is worse than the first. That is how it will be with this wicked generation.\"\n\nWhile Jesus was still talking to the crowd, his mother and brothers stood outside, wanting to speak to him. Someone told him, \"Your mother and brothers are standing outside, wanting to speak to you.\" He replied to him, \"Who is my mother, and who are my brothers?\" Pointing to his disciples, he said, \"Here are my mother and my brothers.

As he was sowing, some seeds fell on the path, and birds came and ate them. Other seeds fell on rocky ground where there wasn't much soil, so they sprouted quickly but withered under the sun because they had no roots. Some seeds fell among thorns, and the thorns grew and choked them. But some seeds fell on good soil and produced a crop, some a hundredfold, some sixty, and some thirty. Whoever has ears, let them hear.\"\n\nThe disciples came to him and asked, \"Why do you speak to them in parables?\" He replied, \"Because the knowledge of the secrets of the kingdom of heaven has been given to you, but not to them. Whoever has will be given more, and they will have an abundance. Whoever does not have, even what they have will be taken from them. This is why I speak to them in parables: though seeing, they do not see; though hearing, they do not hear or understand. In them is fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah: 'You will be ever hearing but never understanding; you will be ever seeing but never perceiving.' For this people's heart has become calloused; they hardly hear with their ears, and they have closed their eyes. Otherwise, they might see with their eyes, hear with their ears, understand with their hearts, and turn, and I would heal them. But blessed are your eyes because they see, and your ears because they hear. Truly I tell you, many prophets and righteous people longed to see what you see but did not see it, and to hear what you hear but did not hear it.\n\n\"Listen then to what the parable of the sower means: When anyone hears the message about the kingdom and does not understand it, the evil one comes and snatches away what was sown in their heart. This is the seed sown along the path. The seed falling on rocky ground refers to someone who hears the word and at once receives it with joy. But since they have no root, they last only a short time. When trouble or persecution comes because of the word, they quickly fall away. The seed falling among the thorns refers to someone who hears the word, but the worries of this life and the deceitfulness of wealth choke the word, making it unfruitful. But the seed falling on good soil refers to someone who hears the word and understands it. This is the one who produces a crop, yielding a hundred, sixty, or thirty times what was sown.\"\n\nHe told them another parable: \"The kingdom of heaven is like a man who sowed good seed in his field. But while everyone was sleeping, his enemy came and sowed weeds among the wheat and went away. When the wheat sprouted and formed heads, then the weeds also appeared. The owner's servants came to him and said, 'Sir, didn't you sow good seed in your field? Where then did the weeds come from?' 'An enemy did this,' he replied. The servants asked him, 'Do you want us to go and pull them up?' 'No,' he answered, 'because while you are pulling the weeds, you may uproot the wheat with them. Let both grow together until the harvest. At that time, I will tell the harvesters: First collect the weeds and tie them in bundles to be burned; then gather the wheat and bring it into my barn.'\"\n\nHe told them another parable: \"The kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed, which a man took and planted in his field. Though it is the smallest of all seeds, yet when it grows, it is the largest of garden plants and becomes a tree, so that the birds come and perch in its branches.\"\n\nHe told them still another parable: \"The kingdom of heaven is like yeast that a woman took and mixed into about sixty pounds of flour until it worked all through the dough.\"\n\nJesus spoke all these things to the crowd in parables; he did not say anything to them without using a parable. So was fulfilled what was spoken through the prophet: \"I will open my mouth in parables, I will utter things hidden since the creation of the world.\"\n\nThen he left the crowd and went into the house. His disciples came to him and said, \"Explain to us the parable of the weeds in the field.\" He answered, \"The one who sowed the good seed is the Son of Man. The field is the world, and the good seed stands for the people of the kingdom. The weeds are the people of the evil one, and the enemy who sows them is the devil. The harvest is the end of the age, and the harvesters are angels. As the weeds are pulled up and burned in the fire, so it will be at the end of the age. The Son of Man will send out his angels, and they will weed out of his kingdom everything that causes sin and all who do evil. They will throw them into the blazing furnace, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth. Then the righteous will shine like the sun in the kingdom of their Father. Whoever has ears, let them hear.\n\n\"The kingdom of heaven is like treasure hidden in a field. When a man found it, he hid it again, and then in his joy went and sold all he had and bought that field. Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant looking for fine pearls. When he found one of great value, he went away and sold everything he had and bought it. Once again, the kingdom of heaven is like a net that was let down into the lake and caught all kinds of fish. When it was full, the fishermen pulled it up on the shore. Then they sat down and collected the good fish in baskets, but threw the bad away. This is how it will be at the end of the age. The angels will come and separate the wicked from the righteous and throw them into the blazing furnace, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.\n\n\"Have you understood all these things?\" Jesus asked. \"Yes,\" they replied. He said to them, \"Therefore every teacher of the law who has become a disciple in the kingdom of heaven is like the owner of a house who brings out of his storeroom new treasures as well as old.\"\n\nWhen Jesus had finished these parables, he moved on from there. Coming to his hometown, he began teaching the people in their synagogue, and they were amazed. \"Where did this man get this wisdom and these miraculous powers?\" they asked. \"Isn't this the carpenter's son? Isn't his mother's name Mary, and aren't his brothers James, Joseph, Simon, and Judas? Aren't all his sisters with us? Where then did this man get all these things?\" And they took offense at him. But Jesus said to them, \"A prophet is not without honor except in his own town and in his own home.\" And he did not do many miracles there because of their lack of faith."}], "temperature": 0, "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"name": "schema", "schema": {"properties": {"translation": {"type": "string"}}, "required": ["translation"], "type": "object"}}}}}

He has risen from the dead, and that's why he can do these powerful things.\" Herod had arrested John, tied him up, and put him in prison because of Herodias, his brother Philip's wife. John had told Herod, \"It's not right for you to have her as your wife.\" Herod wanted to kill John but was afraid of the people because they thought John was a prophet.\n\nDuring Herod's birthday party, Herodias's daughter danced for the guests and pleased Herod. So he promised with an oath to give her whatever she asked. Prompted by her mother, she said, \"Give me John the Baptist's head on a platter.\" The king was sad, but because of his promise and the guests, he ordered it to be done. He sent men to the prison to behead John, and they brought his head on a platter and gave it to the girl, who gave it to her mother.\n\nJohn's disciples came, took his body, and buried it. Then they went and told Jesus. When Jesus heard this, he left in a boat to a quiet place by himself. But the crowds heard about it and followed him on foot from the towns. When Jesus saw the large crowd, he felt compassion for them and healed their sick.\n\nAs evening approached, the disciples came to him and said, \"This is a remote place, and it's already getting late. Send the crowds away so they can go to the villages and buy themselves some food.\" Jesus replied, \"They don't need to go away. You give them something to eat.\" They said, \"We have only five loaves of bread and two fish.\" Jesus said, \"Bring them here to me.\" He directed the people to sit down on the grass. Taking the five loaves and the two fish and looking up to heaven, he gave thanks and broke the loaves. Then he gave them to the disciples, and the disciples gave them to the people. They all ate and were satisfied, and the disciples picked up twelve baskets full of leftover pieces. The number of those who ate was about five thousand men, besides women and children.\n\nImmediately, Jesus made the disciples get into the boat and go ahead of him to the other side while he dismissed the crowd. After he had sent them away, he went up on a mountainside by himself to pray. Later that night, he was there alone, and the boat was already a considerable distance from land, buffeted by the waves because the wind was against it.\n\nShortly before dawn, Jesus went out to them, walking on the lake. When the disciples saw him walking on the lake, they were terrified. \"It's a ghost,\" they said, and cried out in fear. But Jesus immediately said to them: \"Take courage! It is I. Don't be afraid.\" \"Lord, if it's you,\" Peter replied, \"tell me to come to you on the water.\" \"Come,\" he said. Then Peter got down out of the boat, walked on the water, and came toward Jesus. But when he saw the wind, he was afraid and, beginning to sink, cried out, \"Lord, save me!\" Immediately Jesus reached out his hand and caught him. \"You of little faith,\" he said, \"why did you doubt?\" And when they climbed into the boat, the wind died down. Then those who were in the boat worshiped him, saying, \"Truly you are the Son of God.\"\n\nWhen they had crossed over, they landed at Gennesaret. And when the men of that place recognized Jesus, they sent word to all the surrounding country. People brought all their sick to him and begged him to let the sick just touch the edge of his cloak, and all who touched it were healed."}], "temperature": 0, "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"name": "schema", "schema": {"properties": {"translation": {"type": "string"}}, "required": ["translation"], "type": "object"}}}}}

They don't wash their hands before they eat.\" Jesus replied, \"And why do you break God's command for the sake of your tradition? God said, 'Honor your father and mother,' and 'Anyone who curses their father or mother is to be put to death.' But you say that if anyone declares that what might have been used to help their parents is 'devoted to God,' they are not to honor their father or mother with it. Thus you nullify the word of God for the sake of your tradition. You hypocrites! Isaiah was right when he prophesied about you: 'These people honor me with their lips, but their hearts are far from me. They worship me in vain; their teachings are merely human rules.'\"\n\nJesus called the crowd to him and said, \"Listen and understand. What goes into someone's mouth does not defile them, but what comes out of their mouth, that is what defiles them.\" Then the disciples came to him and asked, \"Do you know that the Pharisees were offended when they heard this?\" He replied, \"Every plant that my heavenly Father has not planted will be pulled up by the roots. Leave them; they are blind guides. If the blind lead the blind, both will fall into a pit.\"\n\nPeter said, \"Explain the parable to us.\" Jesus said, \"Are you still so dull? Don't you see that whatever enters the mouth goes into the stomach and then out of the body? But the things that come out of a person's mouth come from the heart, and these defile them. For out of the heart come evil thoughts--murder, adultery, sexual immorality, theft, false testimony, slander. These are what defile a person; but eating with unwashed hands does not defile them.\"\n\nLeaving that place, Jesus withdrew to the region of Tyre and Sidon. A Canaanite woman from that vicinity came to him, crying out, \"Lord, Son of David, have mercy on me! My daughter is demon-possessed and suffering terribly.\" Jesus did not answer a word. So his disciples came to him and urged him, \"Send her away, for she keeps crying out after us.\" He answered, \"I was sent only to the lost sheep of Israel.\" The woman came and knelt before him. \"Lord, help me!\" she said. He replied, \"It is not right to take the children's bread and toss it to the dogs.\" \"Yes it is, Lord,\" she said. \"Even the dogs eat the crumbs that fall from their master's table.\" Then Jesus said to her, \"Woman, you have great faith! Your request is granted.\" And her daughter was healed at that moment.\n\nJesus left there and went along the Sea of Galilee. Then he went up on a mountainside and sat down. Great crowds came to him, bringing the lame, the blind, the crippled, the mute, and many others, and laid them at his feet; and he healed them. The people were amazed when they saw the mute speaking, the crippled made well, the lame walking, and the blind seeing. And they praised the God of Israel.\n\nJesus called his disciples to him and said, \"I have compassion for these people; they have already been with me three days and have nothing to eat. I do not want to send them away hungry, or they may collapse on the way.\" His disciples answered, \"Where could we get enough bread in this remote place to feed such a crowd?\" Jesus asked, \"How many loaves do you have?\" \"Seven,\" they replied, \"and a few small fish.\" He told the crowd to sit down on the ground. Then he took the seven loaves and the fish, and when he had given thanks, he broke them and gave them to the disciples, and they in turn to the people. They all ate and were satisfied. Afterward, the disciples picked up seven basketfuls of broken pieces that were left over. The number of those who ate was four thousand men, besides women and children.

Jesus replied, \"This wicked and unfaithful generation asks for a sign, but no sign will be given except the sign of Jonah.\" Then he left them and went away.\n\nWhen the disciples reached the other side, they realized they had forgotten to bring bread. Jesus said to them, \"Be careful and watch out for the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees.\" The disciples discussed among themselves, thinking it was because they had not brought bread. Aware of this, Jesus said, \"Why are you talking about having no bread? Do you still not understand? Don't you remember the five loaves for the five thousand and how many baskets you gathered? Or the seven loaves for the four thousand and how many baskets you gathered? How is it you don't understand that I was not talking to you about bread? But be on your guard against the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees.\" Then they understood that he was not telling them to guard against the yeast used in bread, but against the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees.\n\nWhen Jesus came to the region of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples, \"Who do people say the Son of Man is?\" They replied, \"Some say John the Baptist; others say Elijah; and still others, Jeremiah or one of the prophets.\" \"But what about you?\" he asked. \"Who do you say I am?\" Simon Peter answered, \"You are the Messiah, the Son of the living God.\" Jesus replied, \"Blessed are you, Simon son of Jonah, for this was not revealed to you by flesh and blood, but by my Father in heaven. And I tell you that you are Peter, and on this rock I will build my church, and the gates of Hades will not overcome it. I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven; whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven.\" Then he ordered his disciples not to tell anyone that he was the Messiah.\n\nFrom that time on, Jesus began to explain to his disciples that he must go to Jerusalem and suffer many things at the hands of the elders, the chief priests, and the teachers of the law, and that he must be killed and on the third day be raised to life. Peter took him aside and began to rebuke him. \"Never, Lord!\" he said. \"This shall never happen to you!\" Jesus turned and said to Peter, \"Get behind me, Satan!

Peter said to Jesus, \"Lord, it's good for us to be here. If you want, I'll make three shelters: one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah.\" While he was still speaking, a bright cloud covered them, and a voice from the cloud said, \"This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased. Listen to him!\" When the disciples heard this, they fell face down to the ground, terrified. But Jesus came and touched them, saying, \"Get up, don't be afraid.\" When they looked up, they saw no one except Jesus.\n\nAs they were coming down the mountain, Jesus instructed them, \"Don't tell anyone what you have seen until the Son of Man has been raised from the dead.\" The disciples asked him, \"Why do the teachers of the law say that Elijah must come first?\" Jesus replied, \"Elijah does come and will restore all things. But I tell you, Elijah has already come, and they did not recognize him, but did to him whatever they wanted. In the same way, the Son of Man is going to suffer at their hands.\" Then the disciples understood that he was talking to them about John the Baptist.\n\nWhen they came to the crowd, a man approached Jesus and knelt before him, saying, \"Lord, have mercy on my son. He has seizures and is suffering greatly. He often falls into the fire or into the water. I brought him to your disciples, but they couldn't heal him.\" Jesus replied, \"You unbelieving and perverse generation, how long shall I stay with you? How long shall I put up with you? Bring the boy here to me.\" Jesus rebuked the demon, and it came out of the boy, and he was healed at that moment.\n\nThen the disciples came to Jesus in private and asked, \"Why couldn't we drive it out?\" He replied, \"Because you have so little faith.

Therefore, whoever takes the lowly position of this child is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven. And whoever welcomes one such child in my name welcomes me. But if anyone causes one of these little ones who believe in me to stumble, it would be better for them to have a large millstone hung around their neck and to be drowned in the depths of the sea. Woe to the world because of the things that cause people to stumble! Such things must come, but woe to the person through whom they come! If your hand or your foot causes you to stumble, cut it off and throw it away. It is better for you to enter life maimed or crippled than to have two hands or two feet and be thrown into eternal fire. And if your eye causes you to stumble, gouge it out and throw it away. It is better for you to enter life with one eye than to have two eyes and be thrown into the fire of hell. See that you do not despise one of these little ones. For I tell you that their angels in heaven always see the face of my Father in heaven. What do you think? If a man owns a hundred sheep, and one of them wanders away, will he not leave the ninety-nine on the hills and go to look for the one that wandered off? And if he finds it, truly I tell you, he is happier about that one sheep than about the ninety-nine that did not wander off. In the same way, your Father in heaven is not willing that any of these little ones should perish. If your brother or sister sins, go and point out their fault, just between the two of you. If they listen to you, you have won them over. But if they will not listen, take one or two others along, so that 'every matter may be established by the testimony of two or three witnesses.' If they still refuse to listen, tell it to the church; and if they refuse to listen even to the church, treat them as you would a pagan or a tax collector. Truly I tell you, whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven. Again, truly I tell you that if two of you on earth agree about anything they ask for, it will be done for them by my Father in heaven. For where two or three gather in my name, there am I with them.\" Then Peter came to Jesus and asked, \"Lord, how many times shall I forgive my brother or sister who sins against me? Up to seven times?\" Jesus answered, \"I tell you, not seven times, but seventy-seven times. Therefore, the kingdom of heaven is like a king who wanted to settle accounts with his servants. As he began the settlement, a man who owed him ten thousand bags of gold was brought to him. Since he was not able to pay, the master ordered that he and his wife and his children and all that he had be sold to repay the debt. At this the servant fell on his knees before him. 'Be patient with me,' he begged, 'and I will pay back everything.' The servant's master took pity on him, canceled the debt and let him go. But when that servant went out, he found one of his fellow servants who owed him a hundred silver coins. He grabbed him and began to choke him. 'Pay back what you owe me!' he demanded. His fellow servant fell to his knees and begged him, 'Be patient with me, and I will pay it back.' But he refused. Instead, he went off and had the man thrown into prison until he could pay the debt. When the other servants saw what had happened, they were outraged and went and told their master everything that had happened. Then the master called the servant in. 'You wicked servant,' he said, 'I canceled all that debt of yours because you begged me to. Shouldn't you have had mercy on your fellow servant just as I had on you?' In anger his master handed him over to the jailers to be tortured, until he should pay back all he owed.

So they are no longer two, but one flesh. Therefore, what God has joined together, let no one separate.\" They asked, \"Why then did Moses command that a man give his wife a certificate of divorce and send her away?\" Jesus replied, \"Moses allowed you to divorce your wives because your hearts were hard. But it was not this way from the beginning. I tell you that anyone who divorces his wife, except for sexual immorality, and marries another woman commits adultery.\" His disciples said to him, \"If this is the situation between a husband and wife, it is better not to marry.\" Jesus replied, \"Not everyone can accept this word, but only those to whom it has been given. For there are eunuchs who were born that way, and there are eunuchs who have been made eunuchs by others, and there are those who choose to live like eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom of heaven.

He told them, 'You also go and work in my vineyard, and I will pay you whatever is right.' So they went. He went out again about noon and three in the afternoon and did the same thing. About five in the afternoon, he went out and found still others standing around. He asked them, 'Why have you been standing here all day long doing nothing?' 'Because no one has hired us,' they answered. He said to them, 'You also go and work in my vineyard.'\n\nWhen evening came, the owner of the vineyard said to his foreman, 'Call the workers and pay them their wages, beginning with the last ones hired and going on to the first.' The workers who were hired about five in the afternoon came and each received a denarius. So when those came who were hired first, they expected to receive more. But each one of them also received a denarius. When they received it, they began to grumble against the landowner. 'These who were hired last worked only one hour,' they said, 'and you have made them equal to us who have borne the burden of the work and the heat of the day.'\n\nBut he answered one of them, 'I am not being unfair to you, friend.

Or are you envious because I am generous?' So the last will be first, and the first will be last.\n\nNow Jesus was going up to Jerusalem. On the way, he took the Twelve aside and said to them, 'We are going up to Jerusalem, and the Son of Man will be delivered over to the chief priests and the teachers of the law. They will condemn him to death and will hand him over to the Gentiles to be mocked and flogged and crucified. On the third day, he will be raised to life.'\n\nThen the mother of Zebedee's sons came to Jesus with her sons and, kneeling down, asked a favor of him. 'What is it you want?' he asked. She said, 'Grant that one of these two sons of mine may sit at your right and the other at your left in your kingdom.'\n\n'You don't know what you are asking,' Jesus said to them. 'Can you drink the cup I am going to drink?' 'We can,' they answered. Jesus said to them, 'You will indeed drink from my cup, but to sit at my right or left is not for me to grant. These places belong to those for whom they have been prepared by my Father.'\n\nWhen the ten heard about this, they were indignant with the two brothers. Jesus called them together and said, 'You know that the rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and their high officials exercise authority over them. Not so with you. Instead, whoever wants to become great among you must be your servant, and whoever wants to be first must be your slave--just as the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many.'\n\nAs Jesus and his disciples were leaving Jericho, a large crowd followed him. Two blind men were sitting by the roadside, and when they heard that Jesus was going by, they shouted, 'Lord, Son of David, have mercy on us!' The crowd rebuked them and told them to be quiet, but they shouted all the louder, 'Lord, Son of David, have mercy on us!'\n\nJesus stopped and called them. 'What do you want me to do for you?' he asked. 'Lord,' they answered, 'we want our sight.' Jesus had compassion on them and touched their eyes. Immediately they received their sight and followed him."}], "temperature": 0, "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"name": "schema", "schema": {"properties": {"translation": {"type": "string"}}, "required": ["translation"], "type": "object"}}}}}

If anyone asks you why, say that the Lord needs them, and they will let them go immediately.\" This happened to fulfill what the prophet said: \"Tell the daughter of Zion, 'Look, your king is coming to you, gentle and riding on a donkey, on a colt, the foal of a donkey.'\"\n\nThe disciples went and did as Jesus instructed. They brought the donkey and the colt, placed their cloaks on them, and Jesus sat on them. A large crowd spread their cloaks on the road, while others cut branches from the trees and spread them on the road. The crowds that went ahead of him and those that followed shouted, \"Hosanna to the Son of David! Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord! Hosanna in the highest heaven!\"\n\nWhen Jesus entered Jerusalem, the whole city was stirred and asked, \"Who is this?\" The crowds answered, \"This is Jesus, the prophet from Nazareth in Galilee.\"\n\nJesus entered the temple courts and drove out all who were buying and selling there. He overturned the tables of the money changers and the benches of those selling doves. He said to them, \"It is written, 'My house will be called a house of prayer,' but you are making it a 'den of robbers.'\"\n\nThe blind and the lame came to him at the temple, and he healed them. But when the chief priests and the teachers of the law saw the wonderful things he did and the children shouting in the temple courts, \"Hosanna to the Son of David,\" they were indignant. \"Do you hear what these children are saying?\" they asked him.\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Jesus, \"have you never read, 'From the lips of children and infants you, Lord, have called forth your praise'?\"\n\nAnd he left them and went out of the city to Bethany, where he spent the night.\n\nEarly in the morning, as Jesus was on his way back to the city, he was hungry. Seeing a fig tree by the road, he went up to it but found nothing on it except leaves. Then he said to it, \"May you never bear fruit again!\" Immediately the tree withered.\n\nWhen the disciples saw this, they were amazed. \"How did the fig tree wither so quickly?\" they asked.\n\nJesus replied, \"Truly I tell you, if you have faith and do not doubt, not only can you do what was done to the fig tree, but also you can say to this mountain, 'Go, throw yourself into the sea,' and it will be done. If you believe, you will receive whatever you ask for in prayer.\"\n\nJesus entered the temple courts, and while he was teaching, the chief priests and the elders of the people came to him. \"By what authority are you doing these things?\" they asked. \"And who gave you this authority?\"\n\nJesus replied, \"I will also ask you one question. If you answer me, I will tell you by what authority I am doing these things. John's baptism--where did it come from? Was it from heaven, or of human origin?\"\n\nThey discussed it among themselves and said, \"If we say, 'From heaven,' he will ask, 'Then why didn't you believe him?' But if we say, 'Of human origin,' we are afraid of the people, for they all hold that John was a prophet.\"\n\nSo they answered Jesus, \"We don't know.\"\n\nThen he said, \"Neither will I tell you by what authority I am doing these things.\n\n\"What do you think? There was a man who had two sons. He went to the first and said, 'Son, go and work today in the vineyard.'\n\n\"'I will not,' he answered, but later he changed his mind and went.\n\n\"Then the father went to the other son and said the same thing. He answered, 'I will, sir,' but he did not go.\n\n\"Which of the two did what his father wanted?\"\n\n\"The first,\" they answered.\n\nJesus said to them, \"Truly I tell you, the tax collectors and the prostitutes are entering the kingdom of God ahead of you. For John came to you to show you the way of righteousness, and you did not believe him, but the tax collectors and the prostitutes did. And even after you saw this, you did not repent and believe him.\n\n\"Listen to another parable: There was a landowner who planted a vineyard. He put a wall around it, dug a winepress in it, and built a watchtower. Then he rented the vineyard to some farmers and moved to another place. When the harvest time approached, he sent his servants to the tenants to collect his fruit.\n\n\"The tenants seized his servants; they beat one, killed another, and stoned a third. Then he sent other servants to them, more than the first time, and the tenants treated them the same way. Last of all, he sent his son to them. 'They will respect my son,' he said.\n\n\"But when the tenants saw the son, they said to each other, 'This is the heir. Come, let's kill him and take his inheritance.' So they took him and threw him out of the vineyard and killed him.\n\n\"Therefore, when the owner of the vineyard comes, what will he do to those tenants?\"\n\n\"He will bring those wretches to a wretched end,\" they replied, \"and he will rent the vineyard to other tenants, who will give him his share of the crop at harvest time.\"\n\nJesus said to them, \"Have you never read in the Scriptures: 'The stone the builders rejected has become the cornerstone; the Lord has done this, and it is marvelous in our eyes'? Therefore I tell you that the kingdom of God will be taken away from you and given to a people who will produce its fruit. Anyone who falls on this stone will be broken to pieces; anyone on whom it falls will be crushed.\"\n\nWhen the chief priests and the Pharisees heard Jesus' parables, they knew he was talking about them. They looked for a way to arrest him, but they were afraid of the crowd because the people held that he was a prophet."}], "temperature": 0, "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"name": "schema", "schema": {"properties": {"translation": {"type": "string"}}, "required": ["translation"], "type": "object"}}}}}

He sent his servants to invite the guests, but they didn't want to come. So, he sent more servants to tell them, 'The feast is ready, the food is prepared, come to the wedding.' But they ignored the invitation and went about their business. Some even mistreated and killed the servants. The king was angry and sent his army to destroy those murderers and burn their city. Then he said to his servants, 'The wedding is ready, but those invited were not worthy. Go to the streets and invite anyone you find.' The servants did so and gathered all they could find, both good and bad, and the wedding hall was filled with guests. But when the king came in to see the guests, he noticed a man not wearing wedding clothes. He asked, 'Friend, how did you get in here without wedding clothes?' The man was speechless. Then the king told the attendants, 'Tie him hand and foot, and throw him outside into the darkness, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.' For many are invited, but few are chosen.\"\n\nThen the Pharisees plotted to trap Jesus with his words. They sent their disciples with the Herodians to him, saying, \"Teacher, we know you are truthful and teach God's way truthfully. You don't care about anyone's opinion because you don't look at people's status. Tell us, is it right to pay taxes to Caesar or not?\" Jesus, knowing their evil intent, said, \"Why are you trying to trap me, you hypocrites? Show me the coin used for the tax.\" They brought him a denarius, and he asked, \"Whose image and inscription is this?\" \"Caesar's,\" they replied. Then he said, \"Give back to Caesar what is Caesar's, and to God what is God's.\" They were amazed and left him.\n\nThat same day, the Sadducees, who say there is no resurrection, came to him with a question: \"Teacher, Moses said if a man dies without children, his brother should marry the widow and have children for him. There were seven brothers among us. The first married and died without children, so his brother married the widow. The same happened to the second and third brother, right down to the seventh. Finally, the woman died. Now then, at the resurrection, whose wife will she be of the seven, since all of them were married to her?\" Jesus replied, \"You are mistaken because you do not know the Scriptures or the power of God. At the resurrection, people will neither marry nor be given in marriage; they will be like the angels in heaven. But about the resurrection of the dead--have you not read what God said to you, 'I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob'? He is not the God of the dead but of the living.\" When the crowds heard this, they were astonished at his teaching.\n\nHearing that Jesus had silenced the Sadducees, the Pharisees got together. One of them, an expert in the law, tested him with this question: \"Teacher, which is the greatest commandment in the Law?\" Jesus replied, \"Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind. This is the first and greatest commandment. And the second is like it: Love your neighbor as yourself. All the Law and the Prophets hang on these two commandments.\"\n\nWhile the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus asked them, \"What do you think about the Messiah? Whose son is he?\" \"The son of David,\" they replied. He said to them, \"How is it then that David, speaking by the Spirit, calls him 'Lord'? For he says, 'The Lord said to my Lord: \"Sit at my right hand until I put your enemies under your feet.\"' If then David calls him 'Lord,' how can he be his son?\" No one could say a word in reply, and from that day on no one dared to ask him any more questions."}], "temperature": 0, "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"name": "schema", "schema": {"properties": {"translation": {"type": "string"}}, "required": ["translation"], "type": "object"}}}}}

So you must be careful to do everything they tell you. But do not do what they do, for they do not practice what they preach. They tie up heavy, cumbersome loads and put them on other people's shoulders, but they themselves are not willing to lift a finger to move them. Everything they do is done for people to see: They make their phylacteries wide and the tassels on their garments long; they love the place of honor at banquets and the most important seats in the synagogues; they love to be greeted with respect in the marketplaces and to be called 'Rabbi' by others.\n\nBut you are not to be called 'Rabbi,' for you have one Teacher, and you are all brothers. And do not call anyone on earth 'father,' for you have one Father, and he is in heaven. Nor are you to be called instructors, for you have one Instructor, the Messiah. The greatest among you will be your servant. For those who exalt themselves will be humbled, and those who humble themselves will be exalted.\n\nWoe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You shut the door of the kingdom of heaven in people's faces. You yourselves do not enter, nor will you let those enter who are trying to. Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You travel over land and sea to win a single convert, and when you have succeeded, you make them twice as much a child of hell as you are.\n\nWoe to you, blind guides! You say, 'If anyone swears by the temple, it means nothing; but anyone who swears by the gold of the temple is bound by that oath.' You blind fools! Which is greater: the gold, or the temple that makes the gold sacred? You also say, 'If anyone swears by the altar, it means nothing; but anyone who swears by the gift on the altar is bound by that oath.' You blind men! Which is greater: the gift, or the altar that makes the gift sacred? Therefore, anyone who swears by the altar swears by it and by everything on it. And anyone who swears by the temple swears by it and by the one who dwells in it. And anyone who swears by heaven swears by God's throne and by the one who sits on it.\n\nWoe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You give a tenth of your spices--mint, dill, and cumin. But you have neglected the more important matters of the law--justice, mercy, and faithfulness. You should have practiced the latter, without neglecting the former. You blind guides! You strain out a gnat but swallow a camel.\n\nWoe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You clean the outside of the cup and dish, but inside they are full of greed and self-indulgence. Blind Pharisee! First clean the inside of the cup and dish, and then the outside also will be clean.\n\nWoe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You are like whitewashed tombs, which look beautiful on the outside but on the inside are full of the bones of the dead and everything unclean. In the same way, on the outside you appear to people as righteous but on the inside you are full of hypocrisy and wickedness.\n\nWoe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You build tombs for the prophets and decorate the graves of the righteous. And you say, 'If we had lived in the days of our ancestors, we would not have taken part with them in shedding the blood of the prophets.' So you testify against yourselves that you are the descendants of those who murdered the prophets. Go ahead, then, and complete what your ancestors started!\n\nYou snakes! You brood of vipers! How will you escape being condemned to hell? Therefore I am sending you prophets and sages and teachers. Some of them you will kill and crucify; others you will flog in your synagogues and pursue from town to town.

Truly I tell you, all this will come on this generation.\n\nJerusalem, Jerusalem, you who kill the prophets and stone those sent to you, how often I have longed to gather your children together, as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings, and you were not willing.

He said to them, \"Do you see all these things? Truly I tell you, not one stone here will be left on another; every one will be thrown down.\" As Jesus was sitting on the Mount of Olives, the disciples came to him privately. \"Tell us,\" they said, \"when will this happen, and what will be the sign of your coming and of the end of the age?\" Jesus answered: \"Watch out that no one deceives you. For many will come in my name, claiming, 'I am the Messiah,' and will deceive many. You will hear of wars and rumors of wars, but see to it that you are not alarmed. Such things must happen, but the end is still to come. Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. There will be famines and earthquakes in various places. All these are the beginning of birth pains. Then you will be handed over to be persecuted and put to death, and you will be hated by all nations because of me. At that time many will turn away from the faith and will betray and hate each other, and many false prophets will appear and deceive many people. Because of the increase of wickedness, the love of most will grow cold, but the one who stands firm to the end will be saved. And this gospel of the kingdom will be preached in the whole world as a testimony to all nations, and then the end will come. So when you see standing in the holy place 'the abomination that causes desolation,' spoken of through the prophet Daniel--let the reader understand--then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains. Let no one on the housetop go down to take anything out of the house. Let no one in the field go back to get their cloak. How dreadful it will be in those days for pregnant women and nursing mothers! Pray that your flight will not take place in winter or on the Sabbath. For then there will be great distress, unequaled from the beginning of the world until now--and never to be equaled again. If those days had not been cut short, no one would survive, but for the sake of the elect those days will be shortened. At that time if anyone says to you, 'Look, here is the Messiah!' or, 'There he is!' do not believe it. For false messiahs and false prophets will appear and perform great signs and wonders to deceive, if possible, even the elect. See, I have told you ahead of time. So if anyone tells you, 'There he is, out in the wilderness,' do not go out; or, 'Here he is, in the inner rooms,' do not believe it. For as lightning that comes from the east is visible even in the west, so will be the coming of the Son of Man. Wherever there is a carcass, there the vultures will gather. Immediately after the distress of those days 'the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light; the stars will fall from the sky, and the heavenly bodies will be shaken.' Then will appear the sign of the Son of Man in heaven. And then all the peoples of the earth will mourn when they see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven, with power and great glory. And he will send his angels with a loud trumpet call, and they will gather his elect from the four winds, from one end of the heavens to the other. Now learn this lesson from the fig tree: As soon as its twigs get tender and its leaves come out, you know that summer is near. Even so, when you see all these things, you know that it is near, right at the door. Truly I tell you, this generation will certainly not pass away until all these things have happened. Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will never pass away. But about that day or hour no one knows, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father. As it was in the days of Noah, so it will be at the coming of the Son of Man. For in the days before the flood, people were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, up to the day Noah entered the ark; and they knew nothing about what would happen until the flood came and took them all away. That is how it will be at the coming of the Son of Man. Two men will be in the field; one will be taken and the other left. Two women will be grinding with a hand mill; one will be taken and the other left. Therefore keep watch, because you do not know on what day your Lord will come. But understand this: If the owner of the house had known at what time of night the thief was coming, he would have kept watch and would not have let his house be broken into. So you also must be ready, because the Son of Man will come at an hour when you do not expect him. Who then is the faithful and wise servant, whom the master has put in charge of the servants in his household to give them their food at the proper time? It will be good for that servant whose master finds him doing so when he returns. Truly I tell you, he will put him in charge of all his possessions. But suppose that servant is wicked and says to himself, 'My master is staying away a long time,' and he then begins to beat his fellow servants and to eat and drink with drunkards. The master of that servant will come on a day when he does not expect him and at an hour he is not aware of. He will cut him to pieces and assign him a place with the hypocrites, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.\""}], "temperature": 0, "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"name": "schema", "schema": {"properties": {"translation": {"type": "string"}}, "required": ["translation"], "type": "object"}}}}}

See, here is what belongs to you.' His master replied, 'You wicked, lazy servant! So you knew that I harvest where I have not sown and gather where I have not scattered seed? Well then, you should have put my money on deposit with the bankers, so that when I returned I would have received it back with interest. So take the bag of gold from him and give it to the one who has ten bags. For whoever has will be given more, and they will have an abundance. Whoever does not have, even what they have will be taken from them. And throw that worthless servant outside, into the darkness, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.'\n\nWhen the Son of Man comes in his glory, and all the angels with him, he will sit on his glorious throne.

When did we see you a stranger and invite you in, or needing clothes and clothe you? When did we see you sick or in prison and go to visit you?' The King will reply, 'Truly I tell you, whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers and sisters of mine, you did for me.'\n\nThen he will say to those on his left, 'Depart from me, you who are cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels.

I tell you, I will not drink from this fruit of the vine from now on until that day when I drink it new with you in my Father's kingdom.\"\n\nWhen they had sung a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives. Then Jesus told them, \"This very night you will all fall away on account of me, for it is written: 'I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock will be scattered.' But after I have risen, I will go ahead of you into Galilee.\"\n\nPeter replied, \"Even if all fall away on account of you, I never will.\" \"Truly I tell you,\" Jesus answered, \"this very night, before the rooster crows, you will disown me three times.\" But Peter declared, \"Even if I have to die with you, I will never disown you.\" And all the other disciples said the same.\n\nThen Jesus went with his disciples to a place called Gethsemane, and he said to them, \"Sit here while I go over there and pray.\" He took Peter and the two sons of Zebedee along with him, and he began to be sorrowful and troubled. Then he said to them, \"My soul is overwhelmed with sorrow to the point of death. Stay here and keep watch with me.\"\n\nGoing a little farther, he fell with his face to the ground and prayed, \"My Father, if it is possible, may this cup be taken from me. Yet not as I will, but as you will.\" Then he returned to his disciples and found them sleeping. \"Couldn't you men keep watch with me for one hour?\" he asked Peter. \"Watch and pray so that you will not fall into temptation. The spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak.\"\n\nHe went away a second time and prayed, \"My Father, if it is not possible for this cup to be taken away unless I drink it, may your will be done.\" When he came back, he again found them sleeping, because their eyes were heavy. So he left them and went away once more and prayed the third time, saying the same thing.\n\nThen he returned to the disciples and said to them, \"Are you still sleeping and resting? Look, the hour has come, and the Son of Man is delivered into the hands of sinners. Rise, let us go! Here comes my betrayer!\"\n\nWhile he was still speaking, Judas, one of the Twelve, arrived. With him was a large crowd armed with swords and clubs, sent from the chief priests and the elders of the people. Now the betrayer had arranged a signal with them: \"The one I kiss is the man; arrest him.\" Going at once to Jesus, Judas said, \"Greetings, Rabbi!\" and kissed him.\n\nJesus replied, \"Do what you came for, friend.\" Then the men stepped forward, seized Jesus, and arrested him. With that, one of Jesus' companions reached for his sword, drew it out, and struck the servant of the high priest, cutting off his ear.\n\n\"Put your sword back in its place,\" Jesus said to him, \"for all who draw the sword will die by the sword. Do you think I cannot call on my Father, and he will at once put at my disposal more than twelve legions of angels? But how then would the Scriptures be fulfilled that say it must happen in this way?\"\n\nIn that hour Jesus said to the crowd, \"Am I leading a rebellion, that you have come out with swords and clubs to capture me? Every day I sat in the temple courts teaching, and you did not arrest me. But this has all taken place that the writings of the prophets might be fulfilled.\" Then all the disciples deserted him and fled.\n\nThose who had arrested Jesus took him to Caiaphas, the high priest, where the teachers of the law and the elders had assembled. But Peter followed him at a distance, right up to the courtyard of the high priest. He entered and sat down with the guards to see the outcome.\n\nThe chief priests and the whole Sanhedrin were looking for false evidence against Jesus so that they could put him to death. But they did not find any, though many false witnesses came forward. Finally, two came forward and declared, \"This fellow said, 'I am able to destroy the temple of God and rebuild it in three days.'\"\n\nThen the high priest stood up and said to Jesus, \"Are you not going to answer? What is this testimony that these men are bringing against you?\" But Jesus remained silent.\n\nThe high priest said to him, \"I charge you under oath by the living God: Tell us if you are the Messiah, the Son of God.\"\n\n\"You have said so,\" Jesus replied. \"But I say to all of you: From now on you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Mighty One and coming on the clouds of heaven.\"\n\nThen the high priest tore his clothes and said, \"He has spoken blasphemy! Why do we need any more witnesses? Look, now you have heard the blasphemy. What do you think?\"\n\n\"He is worthy of death,\" they answered.\n\nThen they spit in his face and struck him with their fists. Others slapped him and said, \"Prophesy to us, Messiah. Who hit you?\"\n\nNow Peter was sitting out in the courtyard, and a servant girl came to him. \"You also were with Jesus of Galilee,\" she said.\n\nBut he denied it before them all. \"I don't know what you're talking about,\" he said.\n\nThen he went out to the gateway, where another servant girl saw him and said to the people there, \"This fellow was with Jesus of Nazareth.\"\n\nHe denied it again, with an oath: \"I don't know the man!\"\n\nAfter a little while, those standing there went up to Peter and said, \"Surely you are one of them; your accent gives you away.\"\n\nThen he began to call down curses, and he swore to them, \"I don't know the man!\" Immediately a rooster crowed.\n\nThen Peter remembered the word Jesus had spoken: \"Before the rooster crows, you will disown me three times.\" And he went outside and wept bitterly."}], "temperature": 0, "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"name": "schema", "schema": {"properties": {"translation": {"type": "string"}}, "required": ["translation"], "type": "object"}}}}}

They tied him up, took him away, and handed him over to Pilate, the governor. When Judas, who had betrayed Jesus, saw that Jesus was condemned, he felt sorry and returned the thirty silver coins to the chief priests and elders, saying, \"I have sinned by betraying innocent blood.\" They replied, \"What is that to us? That's your responsibility.\" So Judas threw the money into the temple and left. Then he went away and hanged himself.\n\nThe chief priests picked up the coins and said, \"It is against the law to put this into the treasury, since it is blood money.\" So they decided to use the money to buy the potter's field as a burial place for foreigners. That is why it has been called the Field of Blood to this day.\n\nThen what was spoken by Jeremiah the prophet was fulfilled: \"They took the thirty silver coins, the price set on him by the people of Israel, and they used them to buy the potter's field, as the Lord commanded me.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Jesus stood before the governor, and the governor asked him, \"Are you the king of the Jews?\" Jesus replied, \"You have said so.\" When he was accused by the chief priests and the elders, he gave no answer. Then Pilate asked him, \"Don't you hear the testimony they are bringing against you?\" But Jesus made no reply, not even to a single charge--to the great amazement of the governor.\n\nNow it was the governor's custom at the festival to release a prisoner chosen by the crowd. At that time they had a well-known prisoner whose name was Barabbas. So when the crowd had gathered, Pilate asked them, \"Which one do you want me to release to you: Barabbas, or Jesus who is called the Messiah?\" For he knew it was out of self-interest that they had handed Jesus over to him.\n\nWhile Pilate was sitting on the judge's seat, his wife sent him this message: \"Don't have anything to do with that innocent man, for I have suffered a great deal today in a dream because of him.\"\n\nBut the chief priests and the elders persuaded the crowd to ask for Barabbas and to have Jesus executed.\n\n\"Which of the two do you want me to release to you?\" asked the governor.\n\n\"Barabbas,\" they answered.\n\n\"What shall I do, then, with Jesus who is called the Messiah?\" Pilate asked.\n\nThey all answered, \"Crucify him!\"\n\n\"Why? What crime has he committed?\" asked Pilate.\n\nBut they shouted all the louder, \"Crucify him!\"\n\nWhen Pilate saw that he was getting nowhere, but that instead an uproar was starting, he took water and washed his hands in front of the crowd. \"I am innocent of this man's blood,\" he said. \"It is your responsibility!\"\n\nAll the people answered, \"His blood is on us and on our children!\"\n\nThen he released Barabbas to them. But he had Jesus flogged, and handed him over to be crucified.\n\nThen the governor's soldiers took Jesus into the Praetorium and gathered the whole company of soldiers around him. They stripped him and put a scarlet robe on him, and then twisted together a crown of thorns and set it on his head. They put a staff in his right hand. Then they knelt in front of him and mocked him. \"Hail, king of the Jews!\" they said. They spit on him, and took the staff and struck him on the head again and again. After they had mocked him, they took off the robe and put his own clothes on him. Then they led him away to crucify him.\n\nAs they were going out, they met a man from Cyrene, named Simon, and they forced him to carry the cross. They came to a place called Golgotha (which means \"the place of the skull\"). There they offered Jesus wine to drink, mixed with gall; but after tasting it, he refused to drink it.\n\nWhen they had crucified him, they divided up his clothes by casting lots. And sitting down, they kept watch over him there. Above his head they placed the written charge against him: THIS IS JESUS, THE KING OF THE JEWS.\n\nTwo rebels were crucified with him, one on his right and one on his left. Those who passed by hurled insults at him, shaking their heads and saying, \"You who are going to destroy the temple and build it in three days, save yourself! Come down from the cross, if you are the Son of God!\"\n\nIn the same way the chief priests, the teachers of the law and the elders mocked him. \"He saved others,\" they said, \"but he can't save himself! He's the king of Israel! Let him come down now from the cross, and we will believe in him. He trusts in God. Let God rescue him now if he wants him, for he said, 'I am the Son of God.'\"\n\nIn the same way the rebels who were crucified with him also heaped insults on him.\n\nFrom noon until three in the afternoon darkness came over all the land. About three in the afternoon Jesus cried out in a loud voice, \"Eli, Eli, lema sabachthani?\" (which means \"My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?\")\n\nWhen some of those standing there heard this, they said, \"He's calling Elijah.\"\n\nImmediately one of them ran and got a sponge. He filled it with wine vinegar, put it on a staff, and offered it to Jesus to drink. The rest said, \"Now leave him alone. Let's see if Elijah comes to save him.\"\n\nAnd when Jesus had cried out again in a loud voice, he gave up his spirit.\n\nAt that moment the curtain of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom. The earth shook, the rocks split and the tombs broke open. The bodies of many holy people who had died were raised to life. They came out of the tombs after Jesus' resurrection and went into the holy city and appeared to many people.\n\nWhen the centurion and those with him who were guarding Jesus saw the earthquake and all that had happened, they were terrified, and exclaimed, \"Surely he was the Son of God!\"\n\nMany women were there, watching from a distance. They had followed Jesus from Galilee to care for his needs. Among them were Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James and Joseph, and the mother of Zebedee's sons.\n\nAs evening approached, there came a rich man from Arimathea, named Joseph, who had himself become a disciple of Jesus. Going to Pilate, he asked for Jesus' body, and Pilate ordered that it be given to him. Joseph took the body, wrapped it in a clean linen cloth, and placed it in his own new tomb that he had cut out of the rock. He rolled a big stone in front of the entrance to the tomb and went away. Mary Magdalene and the other Mary were sitting there opposite the tomb.\n\nThe next day, the one after Preparation Day, the chief priests and the Pharisees went to Pilate. \"Sir,\" they said, \"we remember that while he was still alive that deceiver said, 'After three days I will rise again.' So give the order for the tomb to be made secure until the third day. Otherwise, his disciples may come and steal the body and tell the people that he has been raised from the dead. This last deception will be worse than the first.\"\n\n\"Take a guard,\" Pilate answered. \"Go, make the tomb as secure as you know how.\" So they went and made the tomb secure by putting a seal on the stone and posting the guard."}], "temperature": 0, "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"name": "schema", "schema": {"properties": {"translation": {"type": "string"}}, "required": ["translation"], "type": "object"}}}}}

Suddenly, there was a great earthquake, for an angel of the Lord came down from heaven, rolled back the stone, and sat on it. His appearance was like lightning, and his clothes were white as snow. The guards were so afraid of him that they shook and became like dead men.\n\nThe angel said to the women, \"Do not be afraid, for I know you are looking for Jesus, who was crucified. He is not here; he has risen, just as he said. Come and see the place where he lay. Then go quickly and tell his disciples that he has risen from the dead and is going ahead of you into Galilee. There you will see him. Now I have told you.\"\n\nSo the women hurried away from the tomb, afraid yet filled with joy, and ran to tell his disciples. Suddenly, Jesus met them and said, \"Greetings.\" They came to him, clasped his feet, and worshiped him. Then Jesus said to them, \"Do not be afraid. Go and tell my brothers to go to Galilee; there they will see me.\"\n\nWhile the women were on their way, some of the guards went into the city and reported to the chief priests everything that had happened. When the chief priests had met with the elders and devised a plan, they gave the soldiers a large sum of money, telling them, \"You are to say, 'His disciples came during the night and stole him away while we were asleep.' If this report gets to the governor, we will satisfy him and keep you out of trouble.\" So the soldiers took the money and did as they were instructed. And this story has been widely circulated among the Jews to this very day.\n\nThen the eleven disciples went to Galilee, to the mountain where Jesus had told them to go. When they saw him, they worshiped him, but some doubted. Then Jesus came to them and said, \"All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me. Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you. And surely I am with you always, to the very end of the age.\""}], "temperature": 0, "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"name": "schema", "schema": {"properties": {"translation": {"type": "string"}}, "required": ["translation"], "type": "object"}}}}}
