There was a man named Nicodemus, a Pharisee and a leader of the Jews. He came to Jesus at night and said, "Teacher, we know you have come from God because no one can do the miracles you do unless God is with him." Jesus replied, "Truly, I tell you, unless someone is born again, they cannot see the kingdom of God." Nicodemus asked, "How can someone be born when they are old? Can they enter their mother's womb a second time?" Jesus answered, "Truly, I tell you, unless someone is born of water and the Spirit, they cannot enter the kingdom of God. What is born of the flesh is flesh, and what is born of the Spirit is spirit. Don't be surprised that I said you must be born again. The wind blows where it wants, and you hear its sound, but you don't know where it comes from or where it goes. So it is with everyone born of the Spirit." Nicodemus asked, "How can this be?" Jesus replied, "You are a teacher of Israel, and you don't understand these things? Truly, I tell you, we speak of what we know and testify to what we have seen, but you do not accept our testimony. If I have told you earthly things and you do not believe, how will you believe if I tell you heavenly things? No one has ascended to heaven except the one who came down from heaven, the Son of Man. Just as Moses lifted up the snake in the wilderness, so must the Son of Man be lifted up, so that everyone who believes in him may have eternal life. For God loved the world so much that he gave his only Son, so that everyone who believes in him will not perish but have eternal life. God did not send his Son into the world to condemn it, but to save it through him. Whoever believes in him is not condemned, but whoever does not believe is already condemned because they have not believed in the name of God's only Son. This is the judgment: the light has come into the world, but people loved darkness instead of light because their deeds were evil. Everyone who does evil hates the light and does not come to the light for fear that their deeds will be exposed. But whoever lives by the truth comes to the light, so that it may be seen that their deeds have been done in God. After this, Jesus and his disciples went to the Judean countryside, where he spent some time with them and baptized. John was also baptizing at Aenon near Salim because there was plenty of water, and people were coming and being baptized. John had not yet been put in prison. An argument developed between some of John's disciples and a certain Jew over ceremonial washing. They came to John and said, "Rabbi, the man who was with you on the other side of the Jordan, the one you testified about, is baptizing, and everyone is going to him." John replied, "A person can receive only what is given them from heaven. You yourselves can testify that I said, 'I am not the Messiah but am sent ahead of him.' The bride belongs to the bridegroom. The friend who attends the bridegroom waits and listens for him and is full of joy when he hears the bridegroom's voice. That joy is mine, and it is now complete. He must become greater; I must become less. The one who comes from above is above all; the one who is from the earth belongs to the earth and speaks as one from the earth. The one who comes from heaven is above all. He testifies to what he has seen and heard, but no one accepts his testimony. Whoever has accepted it has certified that God is truthful. For the one whom God has sent speaks the words of God, for God gives the Spirit without limit. The Father loves the Son and has placed everything in his hands. Whoever believes in the Son has eternal life, but whoever rejects the Son will not see life, for God's wrath remains on them."
