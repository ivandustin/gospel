Some people brought him a paralyzed man lying on a bed. Seeing their faith, Jesus said to the paralyzed man, \"Take heart, son; your sins are forgiven.\" Some teachers of the law thought to themselves, \"This man is blaspheming!\" Knowing their thoughts, Jesus said, \"Why do you entertain evil thoughts in your hearts? Which is easier: to say, 'Your sins are forgiven,' or to say, 'Get up and walk'? But to show you that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins...\" Then he said to the paralyzed man, \"Get up, take your mat and go home.\" And the man got up and went home. When the crowd saw this, they were filled with awe and praised God, who had given such authority to men.\n\nAs Jesus went on from there, he saw a man named Matthew sitting at the tax collector's booth. \"Follow me,\" he told him, and Matthew got up and followed him. While Jesus was having dinner at Matthew's house, many tax collectors and sinners came and ate with him and his disciples. When the Pharisees saw this, they asked his disciples, \"Why does your teacher eat with tax collectors and sinners?\" On hearing this, Jesus said, \"It is not the healthy who need a doctor, but the sick. But go and learn what this means: 'I desire mercy, not sacrifice.' For I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners.\"\n\nThen John's disciples came and asked him, \"How is it that we and the Pharisees fast often, but your disciples do not fast?\" Jesus answered, \"How can the guests of the bridegroom mourn while he is with them? The time will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them; then they will fast. No one sews a patch of unshrunk cloth on an old garment, for the patch will pull away from the garment, making the tear worse. Neither do people pour new wine into old wineskins. If they do, the skins will burst; the wine will run out and the wineskins will be ruined. No, they pour new wine into new wineskins, and both are preserved.\"\n\nWhile he was saying this, a synagogue leader came and knelt before him and said, \"My daughter has just died. But come and put your hand on her, and she will live.\" Jesus got up and went with him, and so did his disciples. Just then a woman who had been subject to bleeding for twelve years came up behind him and touched the edge of his cloak. She said to herself, \"If I only touch his cloak, I will be healed.\" Jesus turned and saw her. \"Take heart, daughter,\" he said, \"your faith has healed you.\" And the woman was healed at that moment.\n\nWhen Jesus entered the synagogue leader's house and saw the noisy crowd and people playing pipes, he said, \"Go away. The girl is not dead but asleep.\" But they laughed at him. After the crowd had been put outside, he went in and took the girl by the hand, and she got up. News of this spread through all that region.\n\nAs Jesus went on from there, two blind men followed him, calling out, \"Have mercy on us, Son of David!\" When he had gone indoors, the blind men came to him, and he asked them, \"Do you believe that I am able to do this?\" \"Yes, Lord,\" they replied. Then he touched their eyes and said, \"According to your faith let it be done to you\"; and their sight was restored. Jesus warned them sternly, \"See that no one knows about this.\" But they went out and spread the news about him all over that region.\n\nWhile they were going out, a man who was demon-possessed and could not talk was brought to Jesus. And when the demon was driven out, the man who had been mute spoke. The crowd was amazed and said, \"Nothing like this has ever been seen in Israel.\" But the Pharisees said, \"It is by the prince of demons that he drives out demons.\"\n\nJesus went through all the towns and villages, teaching in their synagogues, proclaiming the good news of the kingdom and healing every disease and sickness. When he saw the crowds, he had compassion on them, because they were harassed and helpless, like sheep without a shepherd. Then he said to his disciples, \"The harvest is plentiful but the workers are few.

The names of the twelve apostles are: Simon, also called Peter, his brother Andrew, James son of Zebedee, his brother John, Philip, Bartholomew, Thomas, Matthew the tax collector, James son of Alphaeus, Thaddaeus, Simon the Zealot, and Judas Iscariot, who later betrayed him.\n\nJesus sent these twelve out with instructions: \"Do not go to the Gentiles or enter any Samaritan town. Instead, go to the lost sheep of Israel. As you go, proclaim this message: 'The kingdom of heaven has come near.' Heal the sick, raise the dead, cleanse those who have leprosy, drive out demons. Freely you have received; freely give. Do not take any gold, silver, or copper in your belts; no bag for the journey or extra shirt or sandals or a staff, for the worker is worth his keep.\n\n\"Whatever town or village you enter, search for some worthy person there and stay at their house until you leave. As you enter the home, give it your greeting. If the home is deserving, let your peace rest on it; if it is not, let your peace return to you. If anyone will not welcome you or listen to your words, leave that home or town and shake the dust off your feet. Truly I tell you, it will be more bearable for Sodom and Gomorrah on the day of judgment than for that town.\n\n\"I am sending you out like sheep among wolves. Therefore be as shrewd as snakes and as innocent as doves. Be on your guard; you will be handed over to the local councils and be flogged in the synagogues. On my account, you will be brought before governors and kings as witnesses to them and to the Gentiles. But when they arrest you, do not worry about what to say or how to say it. At that time you will be given what to say, for it will not be you speaking, but the Spirit of your Father speaking through you.\n\n\"Brother will betray brother to death, and a father his child; children will rebel against their parents and have them put to death. You will be hated by everyone because of me, but the one who stands firm to the end will be saved. When you are persecuted in one place, flee to another. Truly I tell you, you will not finish going through the towns of Israel before the Son of Man comes.\n\n\"The student is not above the teacher, nor a servant above his master. It is enough for students to be like their teachers, and servants like their masters. If the head of the house has been called Beelzebul, how much more the members of his household! So do not be afraid of them, for there is nothing concealed that will not be disclosed, or hidden that will not be made known. What I tell you in the dark, speak in the daylight; what is whispered in your ear, proclaim from the roofs.\n\n\"Do not be afraid of those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul. Rather, be afraid of the One who can destroy both soul and body in hell. Are not two sparrows sold for a penny? Yet not one of them will fall to the ground outside your Father's care. And even the very hairs of your head are all numbered. So don't be afraid; you are worth more than many sparrows.\n\n\"Whoever acknowledges me before others, I will also acknowledge before my Father in heaven. But whoever disowns me before others, I will disown before my Father in heaven.\n\n\"Do not suppose that I have come to bring peace to the earth. I did not come to bring peace, but a sword. For I have come to turn 'a man against his father, a daughter against her mother, a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law-- a man's enemies will be the members of his own household.'\n\n\"Anyone who loves their father or mother more than me is not worthy of me; anyone who loves their son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me. Whoever does not take up their cross and follow me is not worthy of me. Whoever finds their life will lose it, and whoever loses their life for my sake will find it.\n\n\"Anyone who welcomes you welcomes me, and anyone who welcomes me welcomes the one who sent me. Whoever welcomes a prophet as a prophet will receive a prophet's reward, and whoever welcomes a righteous person as a righteous person will receive a righteous person's reward.

John, who was in prison, heard about what Jesus was doing and sent his disciples to ask him, \"Are you the one who is to come, or should we expect someone else?\" Jesus replied, \"Go back and tell John what you hear and see: the blind receive sight, the lame walk, those with leprosy are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, and the good news is proclaimed to the poor. Blessed is anyone who does not stumble on account of me.\"\n\nAs John's disciples were leaving, Jesus began to speak to the crowd about John: \"What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed swayed by the wind? If not, what did you go out to see? A man dressed in fine clothes? No, those who wear fine clothes are in kings' palaces. Then what did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, and more than a prophet. This is the one about whom it is written: 'I will send my messenger ahead of you, who will prepare your way before you.' Truly I tell you, among those born of women there has not risen anyone greater than John the Baptist; yet whoever is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he. From the days of John the Baptist until now, the kingdom of heaven has been subjected to violence, and violent people have been raiding it. For all the Prophets and the Law prophesied until John. And if you are willing to accept it, he is the Elijah who was to come. Whoever has ears, let them hear.\n\n\"To what can I compare this generation? They are like children sitting in the marketplaces and calling out to others: 'We played the pipe for you, and you did not dance; we sang a dirge, and you did not mourn.' For John came neither eating nor drinking, and they say, 'He has a demon.' The Son of Man came eating and drinking, and they say, 'Here is a glutton and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners.' But wisdom is proved right by her deeds.\"\n\nThen Jesus began to denounce the towns in which most of his miracles had been performed, because they did not repent. \"Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the miracles that were performed in you had been performed in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes. But I tell you, it will be more bearable for Tyre and Sidon on the day of judgment than for you. And you, Capernaum, will you be lifted to the heavens? No, you will go down to Hades. For if the miracles that were performed in you had been performed in Sodom, it would have remained to this day. But I tell you that it will be more bearable for Sodom on the day of judgment than for you.\"\n\nAt that time Jesus said, \"I praise you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because you have hidden these things from the wise and learned, and revealed them to little children. Yes, Father, for this is what you were pleased to do. All things have been committed to me by my Father. No one knows the Son except the Father, and no one knows the Father except the Son and those to whom the Son chooses to reveal him.\n\n\"Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you and learn from me, for I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls.

They began to pick some heads of grain and eat them. When the Pharisees saw this, they said to him, \"Look, your disciples are doing what is not lawful on the Sabbath.\" But he said to them, \"Haven't you read what David did when he and his companions were hungry? He entered the house of God, and he and his companions ate the consecrated bread, which was not lawful for them to do, but only for the priests. Or haven't you read in the Law that on the Sabbath the priests in the temple desecrate the day and yet are innocent? I tell you that something greater than the temple is here. If you had known what these words mean, 'I desire mercy, not sacrifice,' you would not have condemned the innocent. For the Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath.\"\n\nThen Jesus went into their synagogue, and a man with a shriveled hand was there. Looking for a reason to accuse Jesus, they asked him, \"Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath?\" He said to them, \"If any of you has a sheep and it falls into a pit on the Sabbath, will you not take hold of it and lift it out? How much more valuable is a person than a sheep! Therefore it is lawful to do good on the Sabbath.\" Then he said to the man, \"Stretch out your hand.\" So he stretched it out and it was completely restored, just as sound as the other. But the Pharisees went out and plotted how they might kill Jesus.\n\nAware of this, Jesus withdrew from that place. A large crowd followed him, and he healed all who were ill. He warned them not to tell others about him. This was to fulfill what was spoken through the prophet Isaiah: \"Here is my servant whom I have chosen, the one I love, in whom I delight; I will put my Spirit on him, and he will proclaim justice to the nations. He will not quarrel or cry out; no one will hear his voice in the streets. A bruised reed he will not break, and a smoldering wick he will not snuff out, till he has brought justice through to victory. In his name the nations will put their hope.\"\n\nThen they brought him a demon-possessed man who was blind and mute, and Jesus healed him, so that he could both talk and see. All the people were astonished and said, \"Could this be the Son of David?\" But when the Pharisees heard this, they said, \"It is only by Beelzebul, the prince of demons, that this fellow drives out demons.\" Jesus knew their thoughts and said to them, \"Every kingdom divided against itself will be ruined, and every city or household divided against itself will not stand. If Satan drives out Satan, he is divided against himself. How then can his kingdom stand? And if I drive out demons by Beelzebul, by whom do your people drive them out? So then, they will be your judges. But if it is by the Spirit of God that I drive out demons, then the kingdom of God has come upon you.\n\nOr again, how can anyone enter a strong man's house and carry off his possessions unless he first ties up the strong man? Then he can plunder his house. Whoever is not with me is against me, and whoever does not gather with me scatters. And so I tell you, every kind of sin and slander can be forgiven, but blasphemy against the Spirit will not be forgiven. Anyone who speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven, but anyone who speaks against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven, either in this age or in the age to come.\n\nMake a tree good and its fruit will be good, or make a tree bad and its fruit will be bad, for a tree is recognized by its fruit. You brood of vipers, how can you who are evil say anything good? For the mouth speaks what the heart is full of. A good man brings good things out of the good stored up in him, and an evil man brings evil things out of the evil stored up in him. But I tell you that everyone will have to give account on the day of judgment for every empty word they have spoken. For by your words you will be acquitted, and by your words you will be condemned.\"\n\nThen some of the Pharisees and teachers of the law said to him, \"Teacher, we want to see a sign from you.\" He answered, \"A wicked and adulterous generation asks for a sign! But none will be given it except the sign of the prophet Jonah. For as Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of a huge fish, so the Son of Man will be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth. The men of Nineveh will stand up at the judgment with this generation and condemn it; for they repented at the preaching of Jonah, and now something greater than Jonah is here. The Queen of the South will rise at the judgment with this generation and condemn it; for she came from the ends of the earth to listen to Solomon's wisdom, and now something greater than Solomon is here.\n\nWhen an impure spirit comes out of a person, it goes through arid places seeking rest and does not find it. Then it says, 'I will return to the house I left.' When it arrives, it finds the house unoccupied, swept clean and put in order. Then it goes and takes with it seven other spirits more wicked than itself, and they go in and live there. And the final condition of that person is worse than the first. That is how it will be with this wicked generation.\"\n\nWhile Jesus was still talking to the crowd, his mother and brothers stood outside, wanting to speak to him. Someone told him, \"Your mother and brothers are standing outside, wanting to speak to you.\" He replied to him, \"Who is my mother, and who are my brothers?\" Pointing to his disciples, he said, \"Here are my mother and my brothers.

Many people gathered around him, so he got into a boat and sat down while the crowd stood on the shore. He spoke to them in parables, saying, \"A farmer went out to sow seeds. As he was sowing, some seeds fell on the path, and birds came and ate them. Other seeds fell on rocky ground where there wasn't much soil, so they sprouted quickly but withered under the sun because they had no roots. Some seeds fell among thorns, and the thorns grew and choked them. But some seeds fell on good soil and produced a crop, some a hundredfold, some sixty, and some thirty. Whoever has ears, let them hear.\"\n\nThe disciples came to him and asked, \"Why do you speak to them in parables?\" He replied, \"Because the knowledge of the secrets of the kingdom of heaven has been given to you, but not to them. Whoever has will be given more, and they will have an abundance. Whoever does not have, even what they have will be taken from them. This is why I speak to them in parables: though seeing, they do not see; though hearing, they do not hear or understand. In them is fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah: 'You will be ever hearing but never understanding; you will be ever seeing but never perceiving.' For this people's heart has become calloused; they hardly hear with their ears, and they have closed their eyes. Otherwise, they might see with their eyes, hear with their ears, understand with their hearts, and turn, and I would heal them. But blessed are your eyes because they see, and your ears because they hear. Truly I tell you, many prophets and righteous people longed to see what you see but did not see it, and to hear what you hear but did not hear it.\n\n\"Listen then to what the parable of the sower means: When anyone hears the message about the kingdom and does not understand it, the evil one comes and snatches away what was sown in their heart. This is the seed sown along the path. The seed falling on rocky ground refers to someone who hears the word and at once receives it with joy. But since they have no root, they last only a short time. When trouble or persecution comes because of the word, they quickly fall away. The seed falling among the thorns refers to someone who hears the word, but the worries of this life and the deceitfulness of wealth choke the word, making it unfruitful. But the seed falling on good soil refers to someone who hears the word and understands it. This is the one who produces a crop, yielding a hundred, sixty, or thirty times what was sown.\"\n\nHe told them another parable: \"The kingdom of heaven is like a man who sowed good seed in his field. But while everyone was sleeping, his enemy came and sowed weeds among the wheat and went away. When the wheat sprouted and formed heads, then the weeds also appeared. The owner's servants came to him and said, 'Sir, didn't you sow good seed in your field? Where then did the weeds come from?' 'An enemy did this,' he replied. The servants asked him, 'Do you want us to go and pull them up?' 'No,' he answered, 'because while you are pulling the weeds, you may uproot the wheat with them. Let both grow together until the harvest. At that time, I will tell the harvesters: First collect the weeds and tie them in bundles to be burned; then gather the wheat and bring it into my barn.'\"\n\nHe told them another parable: \"The kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed, which a man took and planted in his field. Though it is the smallest of all seeds, yet when it grows, it is the largest of garden plants and becomes a tree, so that the birds come and perch in its branches.\"\n\nHe told them still another parable: \"The kingdom of heaven is like yeast that a woman took and mixed into about sixty pounds of flour until it worked all through the dough.\"\n\nJesus spoke all these things to the crowd in parables; he did not say anything to them without using a parable. So was fulfilled what was spoken through the prophet: \"I will open my mouth in parables, I will utter things hidden since the creation of the world.\"\n\nThen he left the crowd and went into the house. His disciples came to him and said, \"Explain to us the parable of the weeds in the field.\" He answered, \"The one who sowed the good seed is the Son of Man. The field is the world, and the good seed stands for the people of the kingdom. The weeds are the people of the evil one, and the enemy who sows them is the devil. The harvest is the end of the age, and the harvesters are angels. As the weeds are pulled up and burned in the fire, so it will be at the end of the age. The Son of Man will send out his angels, and they will weed out of his kingdom everything that causes sin and all who do evil. They will throw them into the blazing furnace, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth. Then the righteous will shine like the sun in the kingdom of their Father. Whoever has ears, let them hear.\n\n\"The kingdom of heaven is like treasure hidden in a field. When a man found it, he hid it again, and then in his joy went and sold all he had and bought that field. Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant looking for fine pearls. When he found one of great value, he went away and sold everything he had and bought it. Once again, the kingdom of heaven is like a net that was let down into the lake and caught all kinds of fish. When it was full, the fishermen pulled it up on the shore. Then they sat down and collected the good fish in baskets, but threw the bad away. This is how it will be at the end of the age. The angels will come and separate the wicked from the righteous and throw them into the blazing furnace, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.\n\n\"Have you understood all these things?\" Jesus asked. \"Yes,\" they replied. He said to them, \"Therefore every teacher of the law who has become a disciple in the kingdom of heaven is like the owner of a house who brings out of his storeroom new treasures as well as old.\"\n\nWhen Jesus had finished these parables, he moved on from there. Coming to his hometown, he began teaching the people in their synagogue, and they were amazed. \"Where did this man get this wisdom and these miraculous powers?\" they asked. \"Isn't this the carpenter's son? Isn't his mother's name Mary, and aren't his brothers James, Joseph, Simon, and Judas? Aren't all his sisters with us? Where then did this man get all these things?\" And they took offense at him. But Jesus said to them, \"A prophet is not without honor except in his own town and in his own home.\" And he did not do many miracles there because of their lack of faith."}], "temperature": 0, "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"name": "schema", "schema": {"properties": {"list": {"items": {"type": "string"}, "title": "List", "type": "array"}}, "required": ["list"], "title": "Schema", "type": "object"}}}}}

John had told Herod, \"It's not right for you to have her as your wife.\" Herod wanted to kill John but was afraid of the people because they thought John was a prophet.\n\nDuring Herod's birthday party, Herodias's daughter danced for the guests and pleased Herod. So he promised with an oath to give her whatever she asked. Prompted by her mother, she said, \"Give me John the Baptist's head on a platter.\" The king was sad, but because of his promise and the guests, he ordered it to be done. He sent men to the prison to behead John, and they brought his head on a platter and gave it to the girl, who gave it to her mother.\n\nJohn's disciples came, took his body, and buried it. Then they went and told Jesus. When Jesus heard this, he left in a boat to a quiet place by himself. But the crowds heard about it and followed him on foot from the towns. When Jesus saw the large crowd, he felt compassion for them and healed their sick.\n\nAs evening approached, the disciples came to him and said, \"This is a remote place, and it's already getting late. Send the crowds away so they can go to the villages and buy themselves some food.\" Jesus replied, \"They don't need to go away. You give them something to eat.\" They said, \"We have only five loaves of bread and two fish.\" Jesus said, \"Bring them here to me.\" He directed the people to sit down on the grass. Taking the five loaves and the two fish and looking up to heaven, he gave thanks and broke the loaves. Then he gave them to the disciples, and the disciples gave them to the people. They all ate and were satisfied, and the disciples picked up twelve baskets full of leftover pieces. The number of those who ate was about five thousand men, besides women and children.\n\nImmediately, Jesus made the disciples get into the boat and go ahead of him to the other side while he dismissed the crowd. After he had sent them away, he went up on a mountainside by himself to pray. Later that night, he was there alone, and the boat was already a considerable distance from land, buffeted by the waves because the wind was against it.\n\nShortly before dawn, Jesus went out to them, walking on the lake. When the disciples saw him walking on the lake, they were terrified. \"It's a ghost,\" they said, and cried out in fear. But Jesus immediately said to them: \"Take courage! It is I. Don't be afraid.\" \"Lord, if it's you,\" Peter replied, \"tell me to come to you on the water.\" \"Come,\" he said. Then Peter got down out of the boat, walked on the water, and came toward Jesus. But when he saw the wind, he was afraid and, beginning to sink, cried out, \"Lord, save me!\" Immediately Jesus reached out his hand and caught him. \"You of little faith,\" he said, \"why did you doubt?\" And when they climbed into the boat, the wind died down. Then those who were in the boat worshiped him, saying, \"Truly you are the Son of God.\"\n\nWhen they had crossed over, they landed at Gennesaret. And when the men of that place recognized Jesus, they sent word to all the surrounding country. People brought all their sick to him and begged him to let the sick just touch the edge of his cloak, and all who touched it were healed."}], "temperature": 0, "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"name": "schema", "schema": {"properties": {"list": {"items": {"type": "string"}, "title": "List", "type": "array"}}, "required": ["list"], "title": "Schema", "type": "object"}}}}}

But you say that if anyone declares that what might have been used to help their parents is 'devoted to God,' they are not to honor their father or mother with it.

These are what defile a person; but eating with unwashed hands does not defile them.\"\n\nLeaving that place, Jesus withdrew to the region of Tyre and Sidon. A Canaanite woman from that vicinity came to him, crying out, \"Lord, Son of David, have mercy on me! My daughter is demon-possessed and suffering terribly.\" Jesus did not answer a word. So his disciples came to him and urged him, \"Send her away, for she keeps crying out after us.\" He answered, \"I was sent only to the lost sheep of Israel.\" The woman came and knelt before him. \"Lord, help me!\" she said. He replied, \"It is not right to take the children's bread and toss it to the dogs.\" \"Yes it is, Lord,\" she said. \"Even the dogs eat the crumbs that fall from their master's table.\" Then Jesus said to her, \"Woman, you have great faith! Your request is granted.\" And her daughter was healed at that moment.\n\nJesus left there and went along the Sea of Galilee. Then he went up on a mountainside and sat down. Great crowds came to him, bringing the lame, the blind, the crippled, the mute, and many others, and laid them at his feet; and he healed them. The people were amazed when they saw the mute speaking, the crippled made well, the lame walking, and the blind seeing. And they praised the God of Israel.\n\nJesus called his disciples to him and said, \"I have compassion for these people; they have already been with me three days and have nothing to eat. I do not want to send them away hungry, or they may collapse on the way.\" His disciples answered, \"Where could we get enough bread in this remote place to feed such a crowd?\" Jesus asked, \"How many loaves do you have?\" \"Seven,\" they replied, \"and a few small fish.\" He told the crowd to sit down on the ground. Then he took the seven loaves and the fish, and when he had given thanks, he broke them and gave them to the disciples, and they in turn to the people. They all ate and were satisfied. Afterward, the disciples picked up seven basketfuls of broken pieces that were left over. The number of those who ate was four thousand men, besides women and children. After Jesus had sent the crowd away, he got into the boat and went to the vicinity of Magadan."}], "temperature": 0, "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"name": "schema", "schema": {"properties": {"list": {"items": {"type": "string"}, "title": "List", "type": "array"}}, "required": ["list"], "title": "Schema", "type": "object"}}}}}

Jesus replied, \"This wicked and unfaithful generation asks for a sign, but no sign will be given except the sign of Jonah.\" Then he left them and went away.\n\nWhen the disciples reached the other side, they realized they had forgotten to bring bread. Jesus said to them, \"Be careful and watch out for the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees.\" The disciples discussed among themselves, thinking it was because they had not brought bread. Aware of this, Jesus said, \"Why are you talking about having no bread? Do you still not understand? Don't you remember the five loaves for the five thousand and how many baskets you gathered? Or the seven loaves for the four thousand and how many baskets you gathered? How is it you don't understand that I was not talking to you about bread? But be on your guard against the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees.\" Then they understood that he was not telling them to guard against the yeast used in bread, but against the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees.\n\nWhen Jesus came to the region of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples, \"Who do people say the Son of Man is?\" They replied, \"Some say John the Baptist; others say Elijah; and still others, Jeremiah or one of the prophets.\" \"But what about you?\" he asked. \"Who do you say I am?\" Simon Peter answered, \"You are the Messiah, the Son of the living God.\" Jesus replied, \"Blessed are you, Simon son of Jonah, for this was not revealed to you by flesh and blood, but by my Father in heaven. And I tell you that you are Peter, and on this rock I will build my church, and the gates of Hades will not overcome it. I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven; whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven.\" Then he ordered his disciples not to tell anyone that he was the Messiah.\n\nFrom that time on, Jesus began to explain to his disciples that he must go to Jerusalem and suffer many things at the hands of the elders, the chief priests, and the teachers of the law, and that he must be killed and on the third day be raised to life. Peter took him aside and began to rebuke him. \"Never, Lord!\" he said. \"This shall never happen to you!\" Jesus turned and said to Peter, \"Get behind me, Satan! You are a stumbling block to me; you do not have in mind the concerns of God, but merely human concerns.\"\n\nThen Jesus said to his disciples, \"Whoever wants to be my disciple must deny themselves and take up their cross and follow me. For whoever wants to save their life will lose it, but whoever loses their life for me will find it. What good will it be for someone to gain the whole world, yet forfeit their soul? Or what can anyone give in exchange for their soul? For the Son of Man is going to come in his Father's glory with his angels, and then he will reward each person according to what they have done. Truly I tell you, some who are standing here will not taste death before they see the Son of Man coming in his kingdom.\""}], "temperature": 0, "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"name": "schema", "schema": {"properties": {"list": {"items": {"type": "string"}, "title": "List", "type": "array"}}, "required": ["list"], "title": "Schema", "type": "object"}}}}}

There, Jesus changed in front of them; his face shone like the sun, and his clothes became as white as light. Suddenly, Moses and Elijah appeared and were talking with Jesus. Peter said to Jesus, \"Lord, it's good for us to be here. If you want, I'll make three shelters: one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah.\" While he was still speaking, a bright cloud covered them, and a voice from the cloud said, \"This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased. Listen to him!\" When the disciples heard this, they fell face down to the ground, terrified. But Jesus came and touched them, saying, \"Get up, don't be afraid.\" When they looked up, they saw no one except Jesus.\n\nAs they were coming down the mountain, Jesus instructed them, \"Don't tell anyone what you have seen until the Son of Man has been raised from the dead.\" The disciples asked him, \"Why do the teachers of the law say that Elijah must come first?\" Jesus replied, \"Elijah does come and will restore all things. But I tell you, Elijah has already come, and they did not recognize him, but did to him whatever they wanted. In the same way, the Son of Man is going to suffer at their hands.\" Then the disciples understood that he was talking to them about John the Baptist.\n\nWhen they came to the crowd, a man approached Jesus and knelt before him, saying, \"Lord, have mercy on my son. He has seizures and is suffering greatly. He often falls into the fire or into the water. I brought him to your disciples, but they couldn't heal him.\" Jesus replied, \"You unbelieving and perverse generation, how long shall I stay with you? How long shall I put up with you? Bring the boy here to me.\" Jesus rebuked the demon, and it came out of the boy, and he was healed at that moment.\n\nThen the disciples came to Jesus in private and asked, \"Why couldn't we drive it out?\" He replied, \"Because you have so little faith. Truly I tell you, if you have faith as small as a mustard seed, you can say to this mountain, 'Move from here to there,' and it will move. Nothing will be impossible for you.\"\n\nWhen they came together in Galilee, Jesus said to them, \"The Son of Man is going to be delivered into the hands of men. They will kill him, and on the third day he will be raised to life.\" And the disciples were filled with grief.\n\nWhen they arrived in Capernaum, the collectors of the two-drachma temple tax came to Peter and asked, \"Doesn't your teacher pay the temple tax?\" \"Yes, he does,\" he replied. When Peter came into the house, Jesus was the first to speak. \"What do you think, Simon? From whom do the kings of the earth collect duty and taxes--from their own children or from others?\" \"From others,\" Peter answered. \"Then the children are exempt,\" Jesus said to him. \"But so that we may not cause offense, go to the lake and throw out your line. Take the first fish you catch; open its mouth and you will find a four-drachma coin. Take it and give it to them for my tax and yours.\""}], "temperature": 0, "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"name": "schema", "schema": {"properties": {"list": {"items": {"type": "string"}, "title": "List", "type": "array"}}, "required": ["list"], "title": "Schema", "type": "object"}}}}}

He said, \"Truly I tell you, unless you change and become like little children, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven. Therefore, whoever takes the lowly position of this child is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven. And whoever welcomes one such child in my name welcomes me. But if anyone causes one of these little ones who believe in me to stumble, it would be better for them to have a large millstone hung around their neck and to be drowned in the depths of the sea. Woe to the world because of the things that cause people to stumble! Such things must come, but woe to the person through whom they come! If your hand or your foot causes you to stumble, cut it off and throw it away. It is better for you to enter life maimed or crippled than to have two hands or two feet and be thrown into eternal fire. And if your eye causes you to stumble, gouge it out and throw it away. It is better for you to enter life with one eye than to have two eyes and be thrown into the fire of hell. See that you do not despise one of these little ones. For I tell you that their angels in heaven always see the face of my Father in heaven. What do you think? If a man owns a hundred sheep, and one of them wanders away, will he not leave the ninety-nine on the hills and go to look for the one that wandered off? And if he finds it, truly I tell you, he is happier about that one sheep than about the ninety-nine that did not wander off. In the same way, your Father in heaven is not willing that any of these little ones should perish. If your brother or sister sins, go and point out their fault, just between the two of you. If they listen to you, you have won them over. But if they will not listen, take one or two others along, so that 'every matter may be established by the testimony of two or three witnesses.' If they still refuse to listen, tell it to the church; and if they refuse to listen even to the church, treat them as you would a pagan or a tax collector. Truly I tell you, whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven. Again, truly I tell you that if two of you on earth agree about anything they ask for, it will be done for them by my Father in heaven. For where two or three gather in my name, there am I with them.\" Then Peter came to Jesus and asked, \"Lord, how many times shall I forgive my brother or sister who sins against me? Up to seven times?\" Jesus answered, \"I tell you, not seven times, but seventy-seven times. Therefore, the kingdom of heaven is like a king who wanted to settle accounts with his servants. As he began the settlement, a man who owed him ten thousand bags of gold was brought to him. Since he was not able to pay, the master ordered that he and his wife and his children and all that he had be sold to repay the debt. At this the servant fell on his knees before him. 'Be patient with me,' he begged, 'and I will pay back everything.' The servant's master took pity on him, canceled the debt and let him go. But when that servant went out, he found one of his fellow servants who owed him a hundred silver coins. He grabbed him and began to choke him. 'Pay back what you owe me!' he demanded. His fellow servant fell to his knees and begged him, 'Be patient with me, and I will pay it back.' But he refused. Instead, he went off and had the man thrown into prison until he could pay the debt. When the other servants saw what had happened, they were outraged and went and told their master everything that had happened. Then the master called the servant in. 'You wicked servant,' he said, 'I canceled all that debt of yours because you begged me to. Shouldn't you have had mercy on your fellow servant just as I had on you?' In anger his master handed him over to the jailers to be tortured, until he should pay back all he owed. This is how my heavenly Father will treat each of you unless you forgive your brother or sister from your heart.\""}], "temperature": 0, "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"name": "schema", "schema": {"properties": {"list": {"items": {"type": "string"}, "title": "List", "type": "array"}}, "required": ["list"], "title": "Schema", "type": "object"}}}}}
