So many gathered that there was no room left, not even outside the door. He was speaking to them, and some people came bringing a paralyzed man carried by four others. They couldn't get him to Jesus because of the crowd, so they made an opening in the roof above Jesus and lowered the man on his mat. Seeing their faith, Jesus said to the paralyzed man, \"Son, your sins are forgiven.\"\n\nSome teachers of the law were sitting there, thinking to themselves, \"Why does this fellow talk like that? He's blaspheming! Who can forgive sins but God alone?\" Immediately, Jesus knew in his spirit that this was what they were thinking, and he said to them, \"Why are you thinking these things? Which is easier: to say to this paralyzed man, 'Your sins are forgiven,' or to say, 'Get up, take your mat and walk'? But I want you to know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins.\" So he said to the man, \"I tell you, get up, take your mat and go home.\" He got up, took his mat, and walked out in full view of them all. This amazed everyone, and they praised God, saying, \"We have never seen anything like this!\"\n\nJesus went out beside the lake again, and a large crowd came to him, and he taught them. As he walked along, he saw Levi, son of Alphaeus, sitting at the tax collector's booth. \"Follow me,\" Jesus told him, and Levi got up and followed him.\n\nWhile Jesus was having dinner at Levi's house, many tax collectors and sinners were eating with him and his disciples, for there were many who followed him. When the teachers of the law who were Pharisees saw him eating with the sinners and tax collectors, they asked his disciples, \"Why does he eat with tax collectors and sinners?\" On hearing this, Jesus said to them, \"It is not the healthy who need a doctor, but the sick. I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners.\"\n\nNow John's disciples and the Pharisees were fasting. Some people came and asked Jesus, \"How is it that John's disciples and the disciples of the Pharisees are fasting, but yours are not?\" Jesus answered, \"How can the guests of the bridegroom fast while he is with them? They cannot, so long as they have him with them. But the time will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them, and on that day they will fast.\"\n\n\"No one sews a patch of unshrunk cloth on an old garment. Otherwise, the new piece will pull away from the old, making the tear worse. And no one pours new wine into old wineskins. Otherwise, the wine will burst the skins, and both the wine and the wineskins will be ruined. No, they pour new wine into new wineskins.\"\n\nOne Sabbath, Jesus was going through the grainfields, and his disciples began to pick some heads of grain. The Pharisees said to him, \"Look, why are they doing what is unlawful on the Sabbath?\" He answered, \"Have you never read what David did when he and his companions were hungry and in need? In the days of Abiathar the high priest, he entered the house of God and ate the consecrated bread, which is lawful only for priests to eat. And he also gave some to his companions.\" Then he said to them, \"The Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath.

People were watching to see if Jesus would heal him on the Sabbath so they could accuse him. Jesus told the man to stand in the middle and asked the people if it was right to do good or harm on the Sabbath, to save a life or to kill. They stayed silent. Jesus was angry and sad about their stubborn hearts. He told the man to stretch out his hand, and when he did, it was healed. The Pharisees left and started plotting with the Herodians on how to kill Jesus.\n\nJesus and his disciples went to the sea, and a large crowd from Galilee, Judea, Jerusalem, Idumea, beyond the Jordan, and around Tyre and Sidon followed him because they heard about what he was doing. Jesus told his disciples to have a small boat ready for him because of the crowd, so they wouldn't crush him. He healed many people, and those with diseases were trying to touch him. Whenever unclean spirits saw him, they fell down and shouted, \"You are the Son of God!\" But Jesus ordered them not to make him known.\n\nJesus went up a mountain and called those he wanted, and they came to him. He appointed twelve apostles to be with him and to send them out to preach and have authority to drive out demons. He named Simon \"Peter,\" James and John \"Sons of Thunder,\" and included Andrew, Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew, Thomas, James son of Alphaeus, Thaddaeus, Simon the Zealot, and Judas Iscariot, who later betrayed him.\n\nJesus went into a house, and a crowd gathered again, making it hard for them to eat. When his family heard about it, they went to take charge of him, saying he was out of his mind. Teachers of the law from Jerusalem said he was possessed by Beelzebul and that he drove out demons by the prince of demons. Jesus called them and spoke in parables, asking how Satan could drive out Satan. He said a kingdom or house divided against itself cannot stand. He explained that no one can enter a strong man's house and steal his possessions unless he first ties up the strong man.\n\nJesus said all sins and blasphemies will be forgiven, but whoever blasphemes against the Holy Spirit will never be forgiven and is guilty of an eternal sin. This was because they said he had an unclean spirit.\n\nJesus' mother and brothers arrived and stood outside, sending someone to call him. A crowd was sitting around him, and they told him, \"Your mother and brothers are outside looking for you.\" Jesus replied, \"Who are my mother and brothers?\" He looked at those sitting around him and said, \"Here are my mother and brothers!

He got into a boat and sat in it on the sea, while the whole crowd was on the land by the sea. He taught them many things in parables and said to them in his teaching, \"Listen! A sower went out to sow. As he sowed, some seed fell along the path, and the birds came and ate it up. Other seed fell on rocky ground, where it didn't have much soil, and it sprang up quickly because the soil was shallow. But when the sun came up, the plants were scorched, and they withered because they had no root. Other seed fell among thorns, which grew up and choked the plants, so they did not bear grain. Still other seed fell on good soil. It came up, grew, and produced a crop, multiplying thirty, sixty, or even a hundred times.\" Then he said, \"Whoever has ears to hear, let them hear.\"\n\nWhen he was alone, the Twelve and the others around him asked him about the parables. He told them, \"The secret of the kingdom of God has been given to you. But to those on the outside, everything is said in parables so that, 'they may be ever seeing but never perceiving, and ever hearing but never understanding; otherwise they might turn and be forgiven!'\"\n\nThen Jesus said to them, \"Don't you understand this parable? How then will you understand any parable? The farmer sows the word. Some people are like seed along the path, where the word is sown. As soon as they hear it, Satan comes and takes away the word that was sown in them. Others, like seed sown on rocky places, hear the word and at once receive it with joy. But since they have no root, they last only a short time. When trouble or persecution comes because of the word, they quickly fall away. Still others, like seed sown among thorns, hear the word; but the worries of this life, the deceitfulness of wealth, and the desires for other things come in and choke the word, making it unfruitful. Others, like seed sown on good soil, hear the word, accept it, and produce a crop--thirty, sixty, or even a hundred times what was sown.\"\n\nHe also said to them, \"Do you bring in a lamp to put it under a bowl or a bed? Instead, don't you put it on its stand? For whatever is hidden is meant to be disclosed, and whatever is concealed is meant to be brought out into the open. If anyone has ears to hear, let them hear.\"\n\n\"Consider carefully what you hear,\" he continued. \"With the measure you use, it will be measured to you--and even more. Whoever has will be given more; whoever does not have, even what they have will be taken from them.\"\n\nHe also said, \"This is what the kingdom of God is like. A man scatters seed on the ground. Night and day, whether he sleeps or gets up, the seed sprouts and grows, though he does not know how. All by itself the soil produces grain--first the stalk, then the head, then the full kernel in the head. As soon as the grain is ripe, he puts the sickle to it, because the harvest has come.\"\n\nAgain he said, \"What shall we say the kingdom of God is like, or what parable shall we use to describe it? It is like a mustard seed, which is the smallest of all seeds on earth. Yet when planted, it grows and becomes the largest of all garden plants, with such big branches that the birds can perch in its shade.\"\n\nWith many similar parables, Jesus spoke the word to them, as much as they could understand. He did not say anything to them without using a parable. But when he was alone with his own disciples, he explained everything.\n\nThat day when evening came, he said to his disciples, \"Let us go over to the other side.\" Leaving the crowd behind, they took him along, just as he was, in the boat. There were also other boats with him. A furious squall came up, and the waves broke over the boat, so that it was nearly swamped. Jesus was in the stern, sleeping on a cushion. The disciples woke him and said to him, \"Teacher, don't you care if we drown?\"\n\nHe got up, rebuked the wind, and said to the waves, \"Quiet! Be still!\" Then the wind died down, and it was completely calm. He said to his disciples, \"Why are you so afraid? Do you still have no faith?\"\n\nThey were terrified and asked each other, \"Who is this?

As soon as Jesus got out of the boat, a man with an unclean spirit came from the tombs to meet him. This man lived in the tombs, and no one could bind him anymore, not even with a chain. He had often been chained hand and foot, but he tore the chains apart and broke the irons on his feet. No one was strong enough to subdue him. Night and day among the tombs and in the hills he would cry out and cut himself with stones.\n\nWhen he saw Jesus from a distance, he ran and fell on his knees in front of him. He shouted at the top of his voice, \"What do you want with me, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? In God's name don't torture me!\" For Jesus had said to him, \"Come out of this man, you impure spirit!\"\n\nThen Jesus asked him, \"What is your name?\"\n\n\"My name is Legion,\" he replied, \"for we are many.\" And he begged Jesus again and again not to send them out of the area.\n\nA large herd of pigs was feeding on the nearby hillside. The demons begged Jesus, \"Send us among the pigs; allow us to go into them.\" He gave them permission, and the impure spirits came out and went into the pigs. The herd, about two thousand in number, rushed down the steep bank into the lake and were drowned.\n\nThose tending the pigs ran off and reported this in the town and countryside, and the people went out to see what had happened. When they came to Jesus, they saw the man who had been possessed by the legion of demons, sitting there, dressed and in his right mind; and they were afraid. Those who had seen it told the people what had happened to the demon-possessed man--and told about the pigs as well. Then the people began to plead with Jesus to leave their region.\n\nAs Jesus was getting into the boat, the man who had been demon-possessed begged to go with him. Jesus did not let him, but said, \"Go home to your own people and tell them how much the Lord has done for you, and how he has had mercy on you.\" So the man went away and began to tell in the Decapolis how much Jesus had done for him. And all the people were amazed.\n\nWhen Jesus had again crossed over by boat to the other side of the lake, a large crowd gathered around him while he was by the lake. Then one of the synagogue leaders, named Jairus, came, and when he saw Jesus, he fell at his feet. He pleaded earnestly with him, \"My little daughter is dying. Please come and put your hands on her so that she will be healed and live.\" So Jesus went with him.\n\nA large crowd followed and pressed around him. And a woman was there who had been subject to bleeding for twelve years. She had suffered a great deal under the care of many doctors and had spent all she had, yet instead of getting better she grew worse. When she heard about Jesus, she came up behind him in the crowd and touched his cloak, because she thought, \"If I just touch his clothes, I will be healed.\" Immediately her bleeding stopped and she felt in her body that she was freed from her suffering.\n\nAt once Jesus realized that power had gone out from him. He turned around in the crowd and asked, \"Who touched my clothes?\"\n\n\"You see the people crowding against you,\" his disciples answered, \"and yet you can ask, 'Who touched me?'\"\n\nBut Jesus kept looking around to see who had done it. Then the woman, knowing what had happened to her, came and fell at his feet and, trembling with fear, told him the whole truth. He said to her, \"Daughter, your faith has healed you. Go in peace and be freed from your suffering.\"\n\nWhile Jesus was still speaking, some people came from the house of Jairus, the synagogue leader. \"Your daughter is dead,\" they said. \"Why bother the teacher anymore?\"\n\nOverhearing what they said, Jesus told him, \"Don't be afraid; just believe.\" He did not let anyone follow him except Peter, James, and John the brother of James. When they came to the home of the synagogue leader, Jesus saw a commotion, with people crying and wailing loudly. He went in and said to them, \"Why all this commotion and wailing? The child is not dead but asleep.\" But they laughed at him.\n\nAfter he put them all out, he took the child's father and mother and the disciples who were with him, and went in where the child was. He took her by the hand and said to her, \"Talitha koum!\" (which means \"Little girl, I say to you, get up!\"). Immediately the girl stood up and began to walk around (she was twelve years old). At this they were completely astonished. He gave strict orders not to let anyone know about this, and told them to give her something to eat."}], "temperature": 0, "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"name": "schema", "schema": {"properties": {"list": {"items": {"type": "string"}, "title": "List", "type": "array"}}, "required": ["list"], "title": "Schema", "type": "object"}}}}}

On the Sabbath, he began teaching in the synagogue, and many who heard him were amazed. They asked, \"Where did he get these things? What is this wisdom that has been given to him, and what are these remarkable miracles he is performing? Isn't this the carpenter, the son of Mary, and the brother of James, Joseph, Judas, and Simon? Aren't his sisters here with us?\" And they took offense at him.\n\nJesus said to them, \"A prophet is not without honor except in his own town, among his relatives, and in his own home.\" He could not do any miracles there, except lay his hands on a few sick people and heal them. He was amazed at their lack of faith.\n\nThen Jesus went around teaching from village to village. Calling the Twelve to him, he began to send them out two by two and gave them authority over impure spirits. He instructed them to take nothing for the journey except a staff--no bread, no bag, no money in their belts. Wear sandals but not an extra shirt. \"Whenever you enter a house, stay there until you leave that town. And if any place will not welcome you or listen to you, leave that place and shake the dust off your feet as a testimony against them.\"\n\nThey went out and preached that people should repent. They drove out many demons and anointed many sick people with oil and healed them.\n\nKing Herod heard about this, for Jesus' name had become well known. Some were saying, \"John the Baptist has been raised from the dead, and that is why miraculous powers are at work in him.\" Others said, \"He is Elijah.\" And still others claimed, \"He is a prophet, like one of the prophets of long ago.\"\n\nBut when Herod heard this, he said, \"John, whom I beheaded, has been raised from the dead!\" For Herod himself had given orders to have John arrested, and he had him bound and put in prison. He did this because of Herodias, his brother Philip's wife, whom he had married. For John had been saying to Herod, \"It is not lawful for you to have your brother's wife.\" So Herodias nursed a grudge against John and wanted to kill him. But she was not able to, because Herod feared John and protected him, knowing him to be a righteous and holy man. When Herod heard John, he was greatly puzzled, yet he liked to listen to him.\n\nFinally, the opportune time came. On his birthday, Herod gave a banquet for his high officials and military commanders and the leading men of Galilee. When the daughter of Herodias came in and danced, she pleased Herod and his dinner guests. The king said to the girl, \"Ask me for anything you want, and I'll give it to you.\" And he promised her with an oath, \"Whatever you ask I will give you, up to half my kingdom.\"\n\nShe went out and said to her mother, \"What shall I ask for?\"\n\n\"The head of John the Baptist,\" she answered.\n\nAt once the girl hurried in to the king with the request: \"I want you to give me right now the head of John the Baptist on a platter.\"\n\nThe king was greatly distressed, but because of his oaths and his dinner guests, he did not want to refuse her. So he immediately sent an executioner with orders to bring John's head. The man went, beheaded John in the prison, and brought back his head on a platter. He presented it to the girl, and she gave it to her mother. On hearing of this, John's disciples came and took his body and laid it in a tomb.\n\nThe apostles gathered around Jesus and reported to him all they had done and taught. Then, because so many people were coming and going that they did not even have a chance to eat, he said to them, \"Come with me by yourselves to a quiet place and get some rest.\" So they went away by themselves in a boat to a solitary place.\n\nBut many who saw them leaving recognized them and ran on foot from all the towns and got there ahead of them. When Jesus landed and saw a large crowd, he had compassion on them, because they were like sheep without a shepherd. So he began teaching them many things.\n\nBy this time it was late in the day, so his disciples came to him. \"This is a remote place,\" they said, \"and it's already very late. Send the people away so that they can go to the surrounding countryside and villages and buy themselves something to eat.\"\n\nBut he answered, \"You give them something to eat.\"\n\nThey said to him, \"That would take more than half a year's wages! Are we to go and spend that much on bread and give it to them to eat?\"\n\n\"How many loaves do you have?\" he asked. \"Go and see.\"\n\nWhen they found out, they said, \"Five--and two fish.\"\n\nThen Jesus directed them to have all the people sit down in groups on the green grass. So they sat down in groups of hundreds and fifties. Taking the five loaves and the two fish and looking up to heaven, he gave thanks and broke the loaves. Then he gave them to his disciples to distribute to the people. He also divided the two fish among them all. They all ate and were satisfied, and the disciples picked up twelve basketfuls of broken pieces of bread and fish. The number of the men who had eaten was five thousand.\n\nImmediately Jesus made his disciples get into the boat and go on ahead of him to Bethsaida, while he dismissed the crowd. After leaving them, he went up on a mountainside to pray.\n\nLater that night, the boat was in the middle of the lake, and he was alone on land. He saw the disciples straining at the oars, because the wind was against them. Shortly before dawn he went out to them, walking on the lake. He was about to pass by them, but when they saw him walking on the lake, they thought he was a ghost. They cried out, because they all saw him and were terrified.\n\nImmediately he spoke to them and said, \"Take courage! It is I. Don't be afraid.\" Then he climbed into the boat with them, and the wind died down. They were completely amazed, for they had not understood about the loaves; their hearts were hardened.\n\nWhen they had crossed over, they landed at Gennesaret and anchored there. As soon as they got out of the boat, people recognized Jesus. They ran throughout that whole region and carried the sick on mats to wherever they heard he was. And wherever he went--into villages, towns, or countryside--they placed the sick in the marketplaces. They begged him to let them touch even the edge of his cloak, and all who touched it were healed."}], "temperature": 0, "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"name": "schema", "schema": {"properties": {"list": {"items": {"type": "string"}, "title": "List", "type": "array"}}, "required": ["list"], "title": "Schema", "type": "object"}}}}}

They noticed that some of his disciples were eating with unwashed hands, which was against the tradition of the elders. The Pharisees and all the Jews do not eat unless they wash their hands properly, following the tradition of the elders. They also do not eat after coming from the market unless they wash, and they follow many other traditions like washing cups, pitchers, and kettles.\n\nThe Pharisees and teachers of the law asked Jesus, \"Why don't your disciples follow the tradition of the elders and eat with unwashed hands?\" Jesus replied, \"Isaiah was right when he prophesied about you hypocrites; as it is written: 'These people honor me with their lips, but their hearts are far from me. They worship me in vain; their teachings are merely human rules.' You have let go of the commands of God and are holding on to human traditions.\"\n\nJesus continued, \"You have a fine way of setting aside the commands of God to observe your own traditions! For Moses said, 'Honor your father and mother,' and, 'Anyone who curses their father or mother is to be put to death.' But you say that if anyone declares that what might have been used to help their father or mother is 'Corban' (that is, devoted to God), then you no longer let them do anything for their father or mother. Thus you nullify the word of God by your tradition that you have handed down. And you do many things like that.\"\n\nAgain Jesus called the crowd to him and said, \"Listen to me, everyone, and understand this. Nothing outside a person can defile them by going into them. Rather, it is what comes out of a person that defiles them.\" After he had left the crowd and entered the house, his disciples asked him about this parable. \"Are you so dull?\" he asked. \"Don't you see that nothing that enters a person from the outside can defile them? For it doesn't go into their heart but into their stomach, and then out of the body.\" (In saying this, Jesus declared all foods clean.)\n\nHe went on: \"What comes out of a person is what defiles them. For it is from within, out of a person's heart, that evil thoughts come--sexual immorality, theft, murder, adultery, greed, malice, deceit, lewdness, envy, slander, arrogance, and folly. All these evils come from inside and defile a person.\"\n\nJesus left that place and went to the vicinity of Tyre. He entered a house and did not want anyone to know it; yet he could not keep his presence secret. In fact, as soon as she heard about him, a woman whose little daughter was possessed by an impure spirit came and fell at his feet. The woman was a Greek, born in Syrian Phoenicia. She begged Jesus to drive the demon out of her daughter.\n\n\"First let the children eat all they want,\" he told her, \"for it is not right to take the children's bread and toss it to the dogs.\" \"Lord,\" she replied, \"even the dogs under the table eat the children's crumbs.\" Then he told her, \"For such a reply, you may go; the demon has left your daughter.\" She went home and found her child lying on the bed, and the demon gone.\n\nThen Jesus left the vicinity of Tyre and went through Sidon, down to the Sea of Galilee and into the region of the Decapolis. There some people brought to him a man who was deaf and could hardly talk, and they begged Jesus to place his hand on him. After he took him aside, away from the crowd, Jesus put his fingers into the man's ears. Then he spit and touched the man's tongue. He looked up to heaven and with a deep sigh said to him, \"Ephphatha!\" (which means \"Be opened!\"). At this, the man's ears were opened, his tongue was loosened, and he began to speak plainly.\n\nJesus commanded them not to tell anyone. But the more he did so, the more they kept talking about it.

If I send them home hungry, they might faint on the way, and some of them have come from far away.\" His disciples answered him, \"Where can anyone get enough bread to feed them here in this deserted place?\" Jesus asked them, \"How many loaves do you have?\" They said, \"Seven.\" He told the crowd to sit down on the ground. Taking the seven loaves, he gave thanks, broke them, and gave them to his disciples to distribute to the people. They also had a few small fish, and after blessing them, he told the disciples to distribute these as well. The people ate and were satisfied, and they collected seven baskets of leftover pieces. About four thousand people were there, and he sent them away. Immediately, he got into the boat with his disciples and went to the region of Dalmanutha.\n\nThe Pharisees came and began to argue with him, asking for a sign from heaven to test him. Sighing deeply in his spirit, he said, \"Why does this generation ask for a sign? Truly I tell you, no sign will be given to this generation.\" Then he left them, got back into the boat, and went to the other side.\n\nThe disciples had forgotten to bring bread, except for one loaf they had with them in the boat. Jesus warned them, \"Watch out for the yeast of the Pharisees and that of Herod.\" They discussed this with one another and said, \"It is because we have no bread.\" Aware of their discussion, Jesus asked them, \"Why are you talking about having no bread? Do you still not see or understand? Are your hearts hardened? Do you have eyes but fail to see, and ears but fail to hear? And don't you remember? When I broke the five loaves for the five thousand, how many basketfuls of pieces did you pick up?\" \"Twelve,\" they replied. \"And when I broke the seven loaves for the four thousand, how many basketfuls of pieces did you pick up?\" They answered, \"Seven.\" He said to them, \"Do you still not understand?\"\n\nThey came to Bethsaida, and some people brought a blind man to Jesus and begged him to touch him. He took the blind man by the hand and led him outside the village. When he had spit on the man's eyes and put his hands on him, Jesus asked, \"Do you see anything?\" He looked up and said, \"I see people; they look like trees walking around.\" Once more Jesus put his hands on the man's eyes. Then his eyes were opened, his sight was restored, and he saw everything clearly. Jesus sent him home, saying, \"Don't even go into the village.\"\n\nJesus and his disciples went on to the villages around Caesarea Philippi. On the way, he asked them, \"Who do people say I am?\" They replied, \"Some say John the Baptist; others say Elijah; and still others, one of the prophets.\" \"But what about you?\" he asked. \"Who do you say I am?\" Peter answered, \"You are the Messiah.\" Jesus warned them not to tell anyone about him.\n\nHe then began to teach them that the Son of Man must suffer many things and be rejected by the elders, the chief priests, and the teachers of the law, and that he must be killed and after three days rise again. He spoke plainly about this, and Peter took him aside and began to rebuke him. But when Jesus turned and looked at his disciples, he rebuked Peter. \"Get behind me, Satan!\" he said. \"You do not have in mind the concerns of God, but merely human concerns.\"\n\nThen he called the crowd to him along with his disciples and said: \"Whoever wants to be my disciple must deny themselves and take up their cross and follow me.

There, he changed in front of them, and his clothes became dazzling white, whiter than anyone on earth could bleach them. Elijah and Moses appeared and talked with Jesus. Peter said to Jesus, \"Teacher, it's good for us to be here. Let's make three shelters: one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah.\" He didn't know what to say because they were so afraid. Then a cloud covered them, and a voice from the cloud said, \"This is my beloved Son. Listen to him!\" Suddenly, when they looked around, they saw no one except Jesus with them.\n\nAs they were coming down the mountain, Jesus told them not to tell anyone what they had seen until the Son of Man had risen from the dead. They kept this to themselves, wondering what \"rising from the dead\" meant. They asked him, \"Why do the teachers of the law say that Elijah must come first?\" Jesus replied, \"Elijah does come first to restore all things. But why is it written that the Son of Man must suffer and be rejected? But I tell you, Elijah has come, and they did to him whatever they wanted, just as it is written about him.\"\n\nWhen they came to the other disciples, they saw a large crowd around them and the teachers of the law arguing with them. As soon as the crowd saw Jesus, they were amazed and ran to greet him. Jesus asked, \"What are you arguing about?\" A man in the crowd answered, \"Teacher, I brought my son to you. He has a spirit that makes him unable to speak. Whenever it seizes him, it throws him to the ground. He foams at the mouth, grinds his teeth, and becomes rigid. I asked your disciples to drive it out, but they couldn't.\" Jesus replied, \"You unbelieving generation! How long shall I stay with you? How long shall I put up with you? Bring the boy to me.\" So they brought him. When the spirit saw Jesus, it immediately threw the boy into a convulsion. He fell to the ground and rolled around, foaming at the mouth.\n\nJesus asked the boy's father, \"How long has he been like this?\" \"From childhood,\" he answered. \"It has often thrown him into fire or water to kill him. But if you can do anything, take pity on us and help us.\" \"If you can?\" said Jesus. \"Everything is possible for one who believes.\" Immediately the boy's father exclaimed, \"I do believe; help me overcome my unbelief!\" When Jesus saw that a crowd was running to the scene, he rebuked the impure spirit. \"You deaf and mute spirit,\" he said, \"I command you, come out of him and never enter him again.\" The spirit shrieked, convulsed him violently, and came out. The boy looked so much like a corpse that many said, \"He's dead.\" But Jesus took him by the hand and lifted him to his feet, and he stood up.\n\nAfter Jesus had gone indoors, his disciples asked him privately, \"Why couldn't we drive it out?\" He replied, \"This kind can come out only by prayer and fasting.\"\n\nThey left that place and passed through Galilee. Jesus did not want anyone to know where they were because he was teaching his disciples. He said to them, \"The Son of Man is going to be delivered into the hands of men. They will kill him, and after three days he will rise.\" But they did not understand what he meant and were afraid to ask him about it.\n\nThey came to Capernaum. When he was in the house, he asked them, \"What were you arguing about on the road?\" But they kept quiet because on the way they had argued about who was the greatest. Sitting down, Jesus called the Twelve and said, \"Anyone who wants to be first must be the very last, and the servant of all.\" He took a little child whom he placed among them. Taking the child in his arms, he said to them, \"Whoever welcomes one of these little children in my name welcomes me; and whoever welcomes me does not welcome me but the one who sent me.\"\n\n\"Teacher,\" said John, \"we saw someone driving out demons in your name and we told him to stop because he was not one of us.\" \"Do not stop him,\" Jesus said. \"For no one who does a miracle in my name can in the next moment say anything bad about me, for whoever is not against us is for us. Truly I tell you, anyone who gives you a cup of water in my name because you belong to the Messiah will certainly not lose their reward.\"\n\n\"If anyone causes one of these little ones--those who believe in me--to stumble, it would be better for them if a large millstone were hung around their neck and they were thrown into the sea. If your hand causes you to stumble, cut it off. It is better for you to enter life maimed than with two hands to go into hell, where the fire never goes out. And if your foot causes you to stumble, cut it off. It is better for you to enter life crippled than to have two feet and be thrown into hell. And if your eye causes you to stumble, pluck it out. It is better for you to enter the kingdom of God with one eye than to have two eyes and be thrown into hell, where the worms that eat them do not die, and the fire is not quenched. Everyone will be salted with fire. Salt is good, but if it loses its saltiness, how can you make it salty again? Have salt among yourselves, and be at peace with each other.\""}], "temperature": 0, "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"name": "schema", "schema": {"properties": {"list": {"items": {"type": "string"}, "title": "List", "type": "array"}}, "required": ["list"], "title": "Schema", "type": "object"}}}}}

Crowds gathered around him again, and as usual, he taught them. Some Pharisees came to test him by asking if it was lawful for a man to divorce his wife. Jesus asked them what Moses commanded, and they replied that Moses allowed a man to write a certificate of divorce. Jesus explained that Moses wrote this law because of their hard hearts, but from the beginning of creation, God made them male and female. Therefore, a man will leave his parents and be united with his wife, and the two will become one flesh. What God has joined together, let no one separate.\n\nLater, the disciples asked Jesus about this again, and he said that anyone who divorces his wife and marries another woman commits adultery. The same goes for a woman who divorces her husband and marries another man.\n\nPeople were bringing children to Jesus for him to bless them, but the disciples scolded them. Jesus was upset and said, \"Let the children come to me, and do not stop them, for the kingdom of God belongs to such as these. Truly, anyone who does not receive the kingdom of God like a child will never enter it.\" He took the children in his arms, placed his hands on them, and blessed them.\n\nAs Jesus was leaving, a man ran up to him and asked, \"Good teacher, what must I do to inherit eternal life?\" Jesus replied, \"Why do you call me good? No one is good except God alone. You know the commandments: Do not murder, do not commit adultery, do not steal, do not give false testimony, do not defraud, honor your father and mother.\" The man said he had kept all these since he was young. Jesus looked at him with love and said, \"You lack one thing: go, sell everything you have and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come, follow me.\" The man went away sad because he had great wealth.\n\nJesus looked around and said to his disciples, \"How hard it is for the rich to enter the kingdom of God!\" The disciples were amazed at his words. Jesus said again, \"Children, how hard it is to enter the kingdom of God! It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter the kingdom of God.\" The disciples were even more amazed and asked, \"Who then can be saved?\" Jesus looked at them and said, \"With man this is impossible, but not with God; all things are possible with God.\"\n\nPeter spoke up, \"We have left everything to follow you!\" Jesus replied, \"Truly I tell you, no one who has left home or family for me and the gospel will fail to receive a hundred times as much in this present age and in the age to come, eternal life. But many who are first will be last, and the last first.\"\n\nAs they were on their way to Jerusalem, Jesus was leading the way, and the disciples were astonished, while those who followed were afraid. He took the twelve aside and told them what was going to happen to him: \"We are going up to Jerusalem, and the Son of Man will be delivered to the chief priests and teachers of the law. They will condemn him to death and hand him over to the Gentiles, who will mock him, spit on him, flog him, and kill him. Three days later he will rise.\"\n\nThen James and John, the sons of Zebedee, came to him and asked, \"Teacher, we want you to do for us whatever we ask.\" Jesus asked what they wanted, and they said, \"Let one of us sit at your right and the other at your left in your glory.\" Jesus said, \"You don't know what you are asking. Can you drink the cup I drink or be baptized with the baptism I am baptized with?\" They said they could, and Jesus told them they would indeed drink the cup and be baptized with the baptism, but to sit at his right or left was not for him to grant.\n\nWhen the other ten disciples heard about this, they became indignant with James and John. Jesus called them together and said, \"You know that those who are regarded as rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and their high officials exercise authority over them. Not so with you. Instead, whoever wants to become great among you must be your servant, and whoever wants to be first must be the slave of all. For even the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many.\"\n\nAs they were leaving Jericho, a blind man named Bartimaeus was sitting by the roadside begging. When he heard that Jesus of Nazareth was passing by, he began to shout, \"Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!\" Many rebuked him and told him to be quiet, but he shouted all the more, \"Son of David, have mercy on me!\" Jesus stopped and said, \"Call him.\" So they called to the blind man, \"Cheer up! On your feet! He's calling you.\" Throwing his cloak aside, he jumped to his feet and came to Jesus.\n\n\"What do you want me to do for you?\" Jesus asked him. The blind man said, \"Rabbi, I want to see.\" Jesus said, \"Go, your faith has healed you.\" Immediately he received his sight and followed Jesus along the road."}], "temperature": 0, "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"name": "schema", "schema": {"properties": {"list": {"items": {"type": "string"}, "title": "List", "type": "array"}}, "required": ["list"], "title": "Schema", "type": "object"}}}}}

Untie it and bring it here. If anyone asks you why you are doing this, say, 'The Lord needs it and will send it back here shortly.'\" So they went and found the young donkey tied outside in the street and untied it. Some people standing there asked, \"What are you doing, untying that donkey?\" They answered as Jesus had told them to, and the people let them go. They brought the donkey to Jesus, threw their cloaks over it, and he sat on it. Many people spread their cloaks on the road, while others spread branches they had cut in the fields. Those who went ahead and those who followed shouted, \"Hosanna! Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord! Blessed is the coming kingdom of our father David! Hosanna in the highest heaven!\" Jesus entered Jerusalem and went into the temple courts. He looked around at everything, but since it was already late, he went out to Bethany with the Twelve. The next day, as they were leaving Bethany, Jesus was hungry. Seeing in the distance a fig tree in leaf, he went to find out if it had any fruit. When he reached it, he found nothing but leaves, because it was not the season for figs. Then he said to the tree, \"May no one ever eat fruit from you again,\" and his disciples heard him say it. On reaching Jerusalem, Jesus entered the temple courts and began driving out those who were buying and selling there. He overturned the tables of the money changers and the benches of those selling doves and would not allow anyone to carry merchandise through the temple courts. And as he taught them, he said, \"Is it not written: 'My house will be called a house of prayer for all nations'? But you have made it a den of robbers.\" The chief priests and the teachers of the law heard this and began looking for a way to kill him, for they feared him, because the whole crowd was amazed at his teaching. When evening came, Jesus and his disciples went out of the city. In the morning, as they went along, they saw the fig tree withered from the roots. Peter remembered and said to Jesus, \"Rabbi, look! The fig tree you cursed has withered!\" \"Have faith in God,\" Jesus answered. \"Truly I tell you, if anyone says to this mountain, 'Go, throw yourself into the sea,' and does not doubt in their heart but believes that what they say will happen, it will be done for them. Therefore I tell you, whatever you ask for in prayer, believe that you have received it, and it will be yours. And when you stand praying, if you hold anything against anyone, forgive them, so that your Father in heaven may forgive you your sins.\" They arrived again in Jerusalem, and while Jesus was walking in the temple courts, the chief priests, the teachers of the law, and the elders came to him. \"By what authority are you doing these things?\" they asked. \"And who gave you authority to do this?\" Jesus replied, \"I will ask you one question. Answer me, and I will tell you by what authority I am doing these things. John's baptism--was it from heaven, or of human origin? Tell me!\" They discussed it among themselves and said, \"If we say, 'From heaven,' he will ask, 'Then why didn't you believe him?' But if we say, 'Of human origin'...\" (They feared the people, for everyone held that John really was a prophet.) So they answered Jesus, \"We don't know.\" Jesus said, \"Neither will I tell you by what authority I am doing these things.\""}], "temperature": 0, "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"name": "schema", "schema": {"properties": {"list": {"items": {"type": "string"}, "title": "List", "type": "array"}}, "required": ["list"], "title": "Schema", "type": "object"}}}}}

He said, \"A man planted a vineyard, put a fence around it, dug a pit for the winepress, and built a watchtower. Then he rented it to some farmers and went away. At harvest time, he sent a servant to collect some of the fruit from the farmers. But they beat him and sent him away empty-handed. He sent another servant, and they hit him on the head and treated him shamefully. He sent another, and they killed him. He sent many others; some they beat, others they killed. Finally, he had one left to send, his beloved son. He sent him last, saying, 'They will respect my son.' But the farmers said to each other, 'This is the heir. Let's kill him, and the inheritance will be ours.' So they took him, killed him, and threw him out of the vineyard. What will the owner of the vineyard do? He will come and destroy the farmers and give the vineyard to others. Haven't you read this scripture: 'The stone the builders rejected has become the cornerstone; the Lord has done this, and it is marvelous in our eyes'?\"\n\nThe religious leaders wanted to arrest Jesus because they knew he had told this story against them, but they were afraid of the crowd. So they left him and went away.\n\nLater, they sent some Pharisees and Herodians to trap him with his own words. They came to him and said, \"Teacher, we know you are truthful and don't care about anyone's opinion because you don't look at people's status but teach the way of God truthfully. Is it right to pay taxes to Caesar or not? Should we pay or shouldn't we?\" But Jesus knew their hypocrisy and said, \"Why are you trying to trap me? Bring me a coin and let me look at it.\" They brought the coin, and he asked them, \"Whose image is this, and whose inscription?\" \"Caesar's,\" they replied. Then Jesus said to them, \"Give back to Caesar what is Caesar's and to God what is God's.\" And they were amazed at him.\n\nThen the Sadducees, who say there is no resurrection, came to him with a question. \"Teacher,\" they said, \"Moses wrote for us that if a man's brother dies and leaves a wife but no children, the man must marry the widow and raise up offspring for his brother. There were seven brothers. The first one married and died without leaving any children. The second one married the widow, but he also died, leaving no child. It was the same with the third. In fact, none of the seven left any children. Last of all, the woman died too. At the resurrection, whose wife will she be, since the seven were married to her?\" Jesus replied, \"Are you not in error because you do not know the Scriptures or the power of God? When the dead rise, they will neither marry nor be given in marriage; they will be like the angels in heaven. Now about the dead rising--have you not read in the Book of Moses, in the account of the burning bush, how God said to him, 'I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob'? He is not the God of the dead, but of the living. You are badly mistaken!\"\n\nOne of the teachers of the law came and heard them debating. Noticing that Jesus had given them a good answer, he asked him, \"Of all the commandments, which is the most important?\" \"The most important one,\" answered Jesus, \"is this: 'Hear, O Israel: The Lord our God, the Lord is one. Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind and with all your strength.' The second is this: 'Love your neighbor as yourself.' There is no commandment greater than these.\" \"Well said, teacher,\" the man replied. \"You are right in saying that God is one and there is no other but him. To love him with all your heart, with all your understanding and with all your strength, and to love your neighbor as yourself is more important than all burnt offerings and sacrifices.\" When Jesus saw that he had answered wisely, he said to him, \"You are not far from the kingdom of God.\" And from then on, no one dared ask him any more questions.\n\nWhile Jesus was teaching in the temple courts, he asked, \"Why do the teachers of the law say that the Messiah is the son of David? David himself, speaking by the Holy Spirit, declared: 'The Lord said to my Lord: \"Sit at my right hand until I put your enemies under your feet.\"' David himself calls him 'Lord.' How then can he be his son?\" The large crowd listened to him with delight.\n\nAs he taught, Jesus said, \"Watch out for the teachers of the law. They like to walk around in flowing robes and be greeted with respect in the marketplaces, and have the most important seats in the synagogues and the places of honor at banquets. They devour widows' houses and for a show make lengthy prayers. These men will be punished most severely.\"\n\nJesus sat down opposite the place where the offerings were put and watched the crowd putting their money into the temple treasury. Many rich people threw in large amounts. But a poor widow came and put in two very small copper coins, worth only a few cents. Calling his disciples to him, Jesus said, \"Truly I tell you, this poor widow has put more into the treasury than all the others. They all gave out of their wealth; but she, out of her poverty, put in everything--all she had to live on.\""}], "temperature": 0, "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"name": "schema", "schema": {"properties": {"list": {"items": {"type": "string"}, "title": "List", "type": "array"}}, "required": ["list"], "title": "Schema", "type": "object"}}}}}

Not one stone will be left on another; every one will be thrown down.\" While he was sitting on the Mount of Olives opposite the temple, Peter, James, John, and Andrew asked him privately, \"Tell us, when will these things happen? And what will be the sign that they are about to be fulfilled?\" Jesus began to say to them, \"Watch out that no one deceives you. Many will come in my name, claiming, 'I am he,' and will deceive many. When you hear of wars and rumors of wars, do not be alarmed. Such things must happen, but the end is still to come. Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. There will be earthquakes in various places, and famines. These are the beginning of birth pains. Be on your guard. You will be handed over to the local councils and flogged in the synagogues. On account of me, you will stand before governors and kings as witnesses to them. And the gospel must first be preached to all nations. Whenever you are arrested and brought to trial, do not worry beforehand about what to say. Just say whatever is given you at the time, for it is not you speaking, but the Holy Spirit. Brother will betray brother to death, and a father his child. Children will rebel against their parents and have them put to death. Everyone will hate you because of me, but the one who stands firm to the end will be saved. When you see 'the abomination that causes desolation' standing where it does not belong--let the reader understand--then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains. Let no one on the housetop go down or enter the house to take anything out. Let no one in the field go back to get their cloak. How dreadful it will be in those days for pregnant women and nursing mothers! Pray that this will not take place in winter, because those will be days of distress unequaled from the beginning, when God created the world, until now--and never to be equaled again. If the Lord had not cut short those days, no one would survive. But for the sake of the elect, whom he has chosen, he has shortened them. At that time if anyone says to you, 'Look, here is the Messiah!' or, 'Look, there he is!' do not believe it. For false messiahs and false prophets will appear and perform signs and wonders to deceive, if possible, even the elect. So be on your guard; I have told you everything ahead of time. But in those days, following that distress, 'the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light; the stars will fall from the sky, and the heavenly bodies will be shaken.' At that time people will see the Son of Man coming in clouds with great power and glory. And he will send his angels and gather his elect from the four winds, from the ends of the earth to the ends of the heavens. Now learn this lesson from the fig tree: As soon as its twigs get tender and its leaves come out, you know that summer is near. Even so, when you see these things happening, you know that it is near, right at the door. Truly I tell you, this generation will certainly not pass away until all these things have happened. Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will never pass away. But about that day or hour no one knows, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father. Be on guard! Be alert! You do not know when that time will come. It's like a man going away: He leaves his house and puts his servants in charge, each with their assigned task, and tells the one at the door to keep watch. Therefore keep watch because you do not know when the owner of the house will come back--whether in the evening, or at midnight, or when the rooster crows, or at dawn.

She broke the jar and poured the perfume on his head. Some of those present were saying indignantly to one another, \"Why this waste of perfume? It could have been sold for more than a year's wages and the money given to the poor.\" And they rebuked her harshly.\n\n\"Leave her alone,\" said Jesus. \"Why are you bothering her? She has done a beautiful thing to me. The poor you will always have with you, and you can help them any time you want. But you will not always have me. She did what she could. She poured perfume on my body beforehand to prepare for my burial. Truly I tell you, wherever the gospel is preached throughout the world, what she has done will also be told, in memory of her.\"\n\nThen Judas Iscariot, one of the Twelve, went to the chief priests to betray Jesus to them. They were delighted to hear this and promised to give him money. So he watched for an opportunity to hand him over.\n\nOn the first day of the Festival of Unleavened Bread, when it was customary to sacrifice the Passover lamb, Jesus' disciples asked him, \"Where do you want us to go and make preparations for you to eat the Passover?\"\n\nSo he sent two of his disciples, telling them, \"Go into the city, and a man carrying a jar of water will meet you. Follow him. Say to the owner of the house he enters, 'The Teacher asks: Where is my guest room, where I may eat the Passover with my disciples?' He will show you a large room upstairs, furnished and ready. Make preparations for us there.\"\n\nThe disciples left, went into the city and found things just as Jesus had told them. So they prepared the Passover.\n\nWhen evening came, Jesus arrived with the Twelve. While they were reclining at the table eating, he said, \"Truly I tell you, one of you will betray me--one who is eating with me.\"\n\nThey were saddened, and one by one they said to him, \"Surely you don't mean me?\"\n\n\"It is one of the Twelve,\" he replied, \"one who dips bread into the bowl with me. The Son of Man will go just as it is written about him. But woe to that man who betrays the Son of Man! It would be better for him if he had not been born.\"\n\nWhile they were eating, Jesus took bread, and when he had given thanks, he broke it and gave it to his disciples, saying, \"Take it; this is my body.\"\n\nThen he took a cup, and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and they all drank from it.\n\n\"This is my blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many,\" he said to them. \"Truly I tell you, I will not drink again from the fruit of the vine until that day when I drink it new in the kingdom of God.\"\n\nWhen they had sung a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives.\n\n\"You will all fall away,\" Jesus told them, \"for it is written: 'I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep will be scattered.' But after I have risen, I will go ahead of you into Galilee.\"\n\nPeter declared, \"Even if all fall away, I will not.\"\n\n\"Truly I tell you,\" Jesus answered, \"today--yes, tonight--before the rooster crows twice you yourself will disown me three times.\"\n\nBut Peter insisted emphatically, \"Even if I have to die with you, I will never disown you.\" And all the others said the same.\n\nThey went to a place called Gethsemane, and Jesus said to his disciples, \"Sit here while I pray.\" He took Peter, James and John along with him, and he began to be deeply distressed and troubled.\n\n\"My soul is overwhelmed with sorrow to the point of death,\" he said to them. \"Stay here and keep watch.\"\n\nGoing a little farther, he fell to the ground and prayed that if possible the hour might pass from him. \"Abba, Father,\" he said, \"everything is possible for you. Take this cup from me. Yet not what I will, but what you will.\"\n\nThen he returned to his disciples and found them sleeping. \"Simon,\" he said to Peter, \"are you asleep? Couldn't you keep watch for one hour? Watch and pray so that you will not fall into temptation. The spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak.\"\n\nOnce more he went away and prayed the same thing. When he came back, he again found them sleeping, because their eyes were heavy. They did not know what to say to him.\n\nReturning the third time, he said to them, \"Are you still sleeping and resting? Enough! The hour has come. Look, the Son of Man is delivered into the hands of sinners. Rise! Let us go! Here comes my betrayer!\"\n\nJust as he was speaking, Judas, one of the Twelve, appeared. With him was a crowd armed with swords and clubs, sent from the chief priests, the teachers of the law, and the elders. Now the betrayer had arranged a signal with them: \"The one I kiss is the man; arrest him and lead him away under guard.\"\n\nGoing at once to Jesus, Judas said, \"Rabbi!\" and kissed him. The men seized Jesus and arrested him. Then one of those standing near drew his sword and struck the servant of the high priest, cutting off his ear.\n\n\"Am I leading a rebellion,\" said Jesus, \"that you have come out with swords and clubs to capture me? Every day I was with you, teaching in the temple courts, and you did not arrest me. But the Scriptures must be fulfilled.\"\n\nThen everyone deserted him and fled.\n\nA young man, wearing nothing but a linen garment, was following Jesus. When they seized him, he fled naked, leaving his garment behind.\n\nThey took Jesus to the high priest, and all the chief priests, the elders and the teachers of the law came together. Peter followed him at a distance, right into the courtyard of the high priest. There he sat with the guards and warmed himself at the fire.\n\nThe chief priests and the whole Sanhedrin were looking for evidence against Jesus so that they could put him to death, but they did not find any. Many testified falsely against him, but their statements did not agree.\n\nThen some stood up and gave this false testimony against him: \"We heard him say, 'I will destroy this temple made with human hands and in three days will build another, not made with hands.'\" Yet even then their testimony did not agree.\n\nThen the high priest stood up before them and asked Jesus, \"Are you not going to answer? What is this testimony that these men are bringing against you?\" But Jesus remained silent and gave no answer.\n\nAgain the high priest asked him, \"Are you the Messiah, the Son of the Blessed One?\"\n\n\"I am,\" said Jesus. \"And you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Mighty One and coming on the clouds of heaven.\"\n\nThe high priest tore his clothes. \"Why do we need any more witnesses?\" he asked. \"You have heard the blasphemy. What do you think?\"\n\nThey all condemned him as worthy of death. Then some began to spit at him; they blindfolded him, struck him with their fists, and said, \"Prophesy!\" And the guards took him and beat him.\n\nWhile Peter was below in the courtyard, one of the servant girls of the high priest came by. When she saw Peter warming himself, she looked closely at him.\n\n\"You also were with that Nazarene, Jesus,\" she said.\n\nBut he denied it. \"I don't know or understand what you're talking about,\" he said, and went out into the entryway.\n\nWhen the servant girl saw him there, she said again to those standing around, \"This fellow is one of them.\" Again he denied it.\n\nAfter a little while, those standing near said to Peter, \"Surely you are one of them, for you are a Galilean.\"\n\nHe began to call down curses, and he swore to them, \"I don't know this man you're talking about.\"\n\nImmediately the rooster crowed the second time. Then Peter remembered the word Jesus had spoken to him: \"Before the rooster crows twice you will disown me three times.\" And he broke down and wept."}], "temperature": 0, "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"name": "schema", "schema": {"properties": {"list": {"items": {"type": "string"}, "title": "List", "type": "array"}}, "required": ["list"], "title": "Schema", "type": "object"}}}}}

They tied up Jesus and took him to Pilate. Pilate asked him, \"Are you the King of the Jews?\" Jesus replied, \"You say so.\" The chief priests accused him of many things, but Jesus did not answer, which surprised Pilate.\n\nDuring the festival, Pilate would release a prisoner chosen by the people. There was a man named Barabbas, who was in prison with rebels who had committed murder. The crowd asked Pilate to release a prisoner as usual. Pilate asked, \"Do you want me to release the King of the Jews?\" He knew the chief priests had handed Jesus over out of envy. But the chief priests stirred up the crowd to ask for Barabbas instead.\n\nPilate asked, \"What should I do with the one you call the King of the Jews?\" They shouted, \"Crucify him!\" Pilate asked, \"Why? What crime has he committed?\" But they shouted even louder, \"Crucify him!\" Wanting to satisfy the crowd, Pilate released Barabbas and handed Jesus over to be crucified.\n\nThe soldiers took Jesus into the courtyard, called the Praetorium, and gathered the whole company of soldiers. They dressed him in a purple robe, twisted a crown of thorns, and put it on his head. They mocked him, saying, \"Hail, King of the Jews!\" They hit him on the head with a staff, spit on him, and knelt in mock worship. After mocking him, they took off the purple robe and put his own clothes back on him. Then they led him out to crucify him.\n\nThey forced a man named Simon from Cyrene, who was coming in from the country, to carry Jesus' cross. They brought Jesus to a place called Golgotha, which means \"Place of the Skull.\" They offered him wine mixed with myrrh, but he did not take it. They crucified him and divided his clothes by casting lots to see what each would get. It was nine in the morning when they crucified him. The written charge against him read: THE KING OF THE JEWS.\n\nThey crucified two rebels with him, one on his right and one on his left. Those who passed by hurled insults at him, shaking their heads and saying, \"So! You who are going to destroy the temple and build it in three days, come down from the cross and save yourself!\" In the same way, the chief priests and teachers of the law mocked him among themselves, saying, \"He saved others, but he can't save himself! Let this Messiah, this King of Israel, come down now from the cross, that we may see and believe.\" Those crucified with him also heaped insults on him.\n\nAt noon, darkness came over the whole land until three in the afternoon. At three in the afternoon, Jesus cried out in a loud voice, \"Eloi, Eloi, lema sabachthani?\" (which means \"My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?\") Some of those standing near heard this and said, \"Listen, he's calling Elijah.\" Someone ran, filled a sponge with wine vinegar, put it on a staff, and offered it to Jesus to drink. \"Leave him alone. Let's see if Elijah comes to take him down,\" he said. With a loud cry, Jesus breathed his last.\n\nThe curtain of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom. And when the centurion, who stood there in front of Jesus, saw how he died, he said, \"Surely this man was the Son of God!\"\n\nSome women were watching from a distance. Among them were Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James the younger and of Joseph, and Salome. In Galilee, these women had followed him and cared for his needs. Many other women who had come up with him to Jerusalem were also there.\n\nIt was Preparation Day (that is, the day before the Sabbath). So as evening approached, Joseph of Arimathea, a prominent member of the Council, who was himself waiting for the kingdom of God, went boldly to Pilate and asked for Jesus' body. Pilate was surprised to hear that he was already dead. Summoning the centurion, he asked him if Jesus had already died. When he learned from the centurion that it was so, he gave the body to Joseph.\n\nSo Joseph bought some linen cloth, took down the body, wrapped it in the linen, and placed it in a tomb cut out of rock. Then he rolled a stone against the entrance of the tomb.

But when they looked up, they saw that the stone, which was very large, had already been rolled away. As they entered the tomb, they saw a young man dressed in a white robe sitting on the right side, and they were alarmed.\n\n\"Don't be alarmed,\" he said. \"You are looking for Jesus the Nazarene, who was crucified. He has risen! He is not here. See the place where they laid him. But go, tell his disciples and Peter, 'He is going ahead of you into Galilee. There you will see him, just as he told you.'\"\n\nTrembling and bewildered, the women went out and fled from the tomb. They said nothing to anyone because they were afraid.\n\nWhen Jesus rose early on the first day of the week, he appeared first to Mary Magdalene, out of whom he had driven seven demons. She went and told those who had been with him and who were mourning and weeping. When they heard that Jesus was alive and that she had seen him, they did not believe it.\n\nAfterward, Jesus appeared in a different form to two of them while they were walking in the country. These returned and reported it to the rest, but they did not believe them either.\n\nLater, Jesus appeared to the Eleven as they were eating; he rebuked them for their lack of faith and their stubborn refusal to believe those who had seen him after he had risen.\n\nHe said to them, \"Go into all the world and preach the gospel to all creation. Whoever believes and is baptized will be saved, but whoever does not believe will be condemned.

Because Joseph, her husband, was faithful to the law and did not want to expose her to public disgrace, he had in mind to divorce her quietly. But after he had considered this, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream and said, \"Joseph son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary home as your wife, because what is conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit. She will give birth to a son, and you are to give him the name Jesus, because he will save his people from their sins.\" All this took place to fulfill what the Lord had said through the prophet: \"The virgin will conceive and give birth to a son, and they will call him Immanuel\" (which means \"God with us\"). When Joseph woke up, he did what the angel of the Lord had commanded him and took Mary home as his wife. But he did not consummate their marriage until she gave birth to a son.

He gathered all the chief priests and scribes of the people and asked them where the Christ was to be born. They told him, \"In Bethlehem of Judea, for this is what the prophet wrote: 'And you, Bethlehem, in the land of Judah, are by no means least among the rulers of Judah; for out of you will come a ruler who will shepherd my people Israel.'\"\n\nThen Herod secretly called the wise men and found out from them the exact time the star had appeared. He sent them to Bethlehem and said, \"Go and search carefully for the child. When you find him, report back to me so that I too may go and worship him.\" After hearing the king, they went on their way, and the star they had seen in the East went ahead of them until it stopped over the place where the child was. When they saw the star, they were overjoyed. They went into the house and saw the child with Mary, his mother, and they bowed down and worshiped him. They opened their treasures and presented him with gifts of gold, frankincense, and myrrh.\n\nHaving been warned in a dream not to return to Herod, they went back to their country by another route. After they had left, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream and said, \"Get up, take the child and his mother, and escape to Egypt. Stay there until I tell you, for Herod is going to search for the child to kill him.\" So Joseph got up, took the child and his mother during the night, and left for Egypt, where they stayed until the death of Herod. This fulfilled what the Lord had said through the prophet: \"Out of Egypt I called my son.\"\n\nWhen Herod realized that he had been outwitted by the wise men, he was furious, and he ordered the killing of all the boys in Bethlehem and its vicinity who were two years old and under, according to the time he had learned from the wise men. Then what was said through the prophet Jeremiah was fulfilled: \"A voice is heard in Ramah, weeping and great mourning, Rachel weeping for her children and refusing to be comforted, because they are no more.\"\n\nAfter Herod died, an angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt and said, \"Get up, take the child and his mother, and go to the land of Israel, for those who were trying to take the child's life are dead.\" So Joseph got up, took the child and his mother, and went to the land of Israel. But when he heard that Archelaus was reigning in Judea in place of his father Herod, he was afraid to go there.

His food was locusts and wild honey. People from Jerusalem, all of Judea, and the area around the Jordan River came to him. They confessed their sins and were baptized by him in the Jordan River.\n\nWhen John saw many Pharisees and Sadducees coming to be baptized, he said to them, \"You brood of vipers!

Blessed are the pure in heart, for they will see God. Blessed are the peacemakers, for they will be called children of God. Blessed are those who are persecuted because of righteousness, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. Blessed are you when people insult you, persecute you, and falsely say all kinds of evil against you because of me. Rejoice and be glad, because great is your reward in heaven, for in the same way they persecuted the prophets who were before you.\n\nYou are the salt of the earth. But if the salt loses its saltiness, how can it be made salty again? It is no longer good for anything, except to be thrown out and trampled underfoot. You are the light of the world. A town built on a hill cannot be hidden. Neither do people light a lamp and put it under a bowl. Instead, they put it on its stand, and it gives light to everyone in the house. In the same way, let your light shine before others, that they may see your good deeds and glorify your Father in heaven.\n\nDo not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them. For truly I tell you, until heaven and earth disappear, not the smallest letter, not the least stroke of a pen, will by any means disappear from the Law until everything is accomplished. Therefore, anyone who sets aside one of the least of these commands and teaches others accordingly will be called least in the kingdom of heaven, but whoever practices and teaches these commands will be called great in the kingdom of heaven.

But I tell you that anyone who looks at a woman lustfully has already committed adultery with her in his heart. If your right eye causes you to stumble, gouge it out and throw it away. It is better for you to lose one part of your body than for your whole body to be thrown into hell. And if your right hand causes you to stumble, cut it off and throw it away. It is better for you to lose one part of your body than for your whole body to go into hell.\n\nIt has been said, 'Anyone who divorces his wife must give her a certificate of divorce.' But I tell you that anyone who divorces his wife, except for sexual immorality, makes her the victim of adultery, and anyone who marries a divorced woman commits adultery.\n\nAgain, you have heard that it was said to the people long ago, 'Do not break your oath, but fulfill to the Lord the vows you have made.' But I tell you, do not swear an oath at all: either by heaven, for it is God's throne; or by the earth, for it is his footstool; or by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the Great King. And do not swear by your head, for you cannot make even one hair white or black. All you need to say is simply 'Yes' or 'No'; anything beyond this comes from the evil one.\n\nYou have heard that it was said, 'Eye for eye, and tooth for tooth.' But I tell you, do not resist an evil person. If anyone slaps you on the right cheek, turn to them the other cheek also. And if anyone wants to sue you and take your shirt, hand over your coat as well. If anyone forces you to go one mile, go with them two miles. Give to the one who asks you, and do not turn away from the one who wants to borrow from you.\n\nYou have heard that it was said, 'Love your neighbor and hate your enemy.' But I tell you, love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you, that you may be children of your Father in heaven. He causes his sun to rise on the evil and the good, and sends rain on the righteous and the unrighteous. If you love those who love you, what reward will you get?

Either you will hate the one and love the other, or you will be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve both God and money.\n\nTherefore I tell you, do not worry about your life, what you will eat or drink; or about your body, what you will wear. Is not life more than food, and the body more than clothes? Look at the birds of the air; they do not sow or reap or store away in barns, and yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not much more valuable than they?\n\nCan any one of you by worrying add a single hour to your life?\n\nAnd why do you worry about clothes? See how the flowers of the field grow. They do not labor or spin. Yet I tell you that not even Solomon in all his splendor was dressed like one of these. If that is how God clothes the grass of the field, which is here today and tomorrow is thrown into the fire, will he not much more clothe you--you of little faith?\n\nSo do not worry, saying, \"What shall we eat?\" or \"What shall we drink?\" or \"What shall we wear?\" For the pagans run after all these things, and your heavenly Father knows that you need them. But seek first his kingdom and his righteousness, and all these things will be given to you as well.\n\nTherefore do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about itself. Each day has enough trouble of its own."}], "temperature": 0, "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"name": "schema", "schema": {"properties": {"list": {"items": {"type": "string"}, "title": "List", "type": "array"}}, "required": ["list"], "title": "Schema", "type": "object"}}}}}

The way you judge others is how you will be judged, and the measure you use will be used on you. Why do you notice the small speck in your brother's eye but ignore the big log in your own eye?

You hypocrite, first take the log out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to remove the speck from your brother's eye.\n\nDon't give what is holy to dogs, and don't throw your pearls to pigs, or they will trample them underfoot and turn to attack you.\n\nAsk, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock, and the door will be opened to you.

A good tree cannot bear bad fruit, and a bad tree cannot bear good fruit. Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.

Away from me, you evildoers!\"\n\nTherefore, everyone who hears these words of mine and puts them into practice is like a wise man who built his house on the rock.

But everyone who hears these words of mine and does not put them into practice is like a foolish man who built his house on sand.

A man with leprosy came and knelt before him, saying, \"Lord, if you are willing, you can make me clean.\" Jesus reached out his hand and touched the man, saying, \"I am willing. Be clean!\" Immediately, the leprosy left him. Jesus told him, \"See that you don't tell anyone, but go, show yourself to the priest and offer the gift Moses commanded, as a testimony to them.\"\n\nWhen Jesus entered Capernaum, a centurion came to him, asking for help. \"Lord,\" he said, \"my servant lies at home paralyzed, suffering terribly.\" Jesus said to him, \"Shall I come and heal him?\" The centurion replied, \"Lord, I do not deserve to have you come under my roof. But just say the word, and my servant will be healed. For I myself am a man under authority, with soldiers under me. I tell this one, 'Go,' and he goes; and that one, 'Come,' and he comes. I say to my servant, 'Do this,' and he does it.\" When Jesus heard this, he was amazed and said to those following him, \"Truly I tell you, I have not found anyone in Israel with such great faith. I say to you that many will come from the east and the west, and will take their places at the feast with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven. But the subjects of the kingdom will be thrown outside, into the darkness, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.\" Then Jesus said to the centurion, \"Go! Let it be done just as you believed it would.\" And his servant was healed at that moment.\n\nWhen Jesus came into Peter's house, he saw Peter's mother-in-law lying in bed with a fever. He touched her hand and the fever left her, and she got up and began to wait on him. When evening came, many who were demon-possessed were brought to him, and he drove out the spirits with a word and healed all the sick. This was to fulfill what was spoken through the prophet Isaiah: \"He took up our infirmities and bore our diseases.\"\n\nWhen Jesus saw the crowd around him, he gave orders to cross to the other side of the lake. Then a teacher of the law came to him and said, \"Teacher, I will follow you wherever you go.\" Jesus replied, \"Foxes have dens and birds have nests, but the Son of Man has no place to lay his head.\" Another disciple said to him, \"Lord, first let me go and bury my father.\" But Jesus told him, \"Follow me, and let the dead bury their own dead.\"\n\nThen he got into the boat and his disciples followed him. Suddenly a furious storm came up on the lake, so that the waves swept over the boat. But Jesus was sleeping. The disciples went and woke him, saying, \"Lord, save us! We're going to drown!\" He replied, \"You of little faith, why are you so afraid?\" Then he got up and rebuked the winds and the waves, and it was completely calm. The men were amazed and asked, \"What kind of man is this? Even the winds and the waves obey him!\"\n\nWhen he arrived at the other side in the region of the Gadarenes, two demon-possessed men coming from the tombs met him. They were so violent that no one could pass that way. \"What do you want with us, Son of God?\" they shouted. \"Have you come here to torture us before the appointed time?\" Some distance from them a large herd of pigs was feeding. The demons begged Jesus, \"If you drive us out, send us into the herd of pigs.\" He said to them, \"Go!\" So they came out and went into the pigs, and the whole herd rushed down the steep bank into the lake and died in the water. Those tending the pigs ran off, went into the town and reported all this, including what had happened to the demon-possessed men. Then the whole town went out to meet Jesus. And when they saw him, they pleaded with him to leave their region."}], "temperature": 0, "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"name": "schema", "schema": {"properties": {"list": {"items": {"type": "string"}, "title": "List", "type": "array"}}, "required": ["list"], "title": "Schema", "type": "object"}}}}}
