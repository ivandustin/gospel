## John 1

In the beginning, there was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.

He was with God in the beginning.

Everything was made through Him, and nothing was made without Him.

In Him was life, and that life was the light of all people.

The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness has not overcome it.

There was a man sent from God whose name was John.

He came as a witness to testify about the light, so that through him all might believe.

He himself was not the light; he came only as a witness to the light.

The true light that gives light to everyone was coming into the world.

He was in the world, and though the world was made through Him, the world did not recognize Him.

He came to His own, but His own did not receive Him.

Yet to all who did receive Him, to those who believed in His name, He gave the right to become children of God--children born not of natural descent, nor of human decision or a husband's will, but born of God.

The Word became flesh and made His dwelling among us.

We have seen His glory, the glory of the one and only Son, who came from the Father, full of grace and truth.

John testified about Him.

He cried out, saying, "This is the one I spoke about when I said, 'He who comes after me has surpassed me because He was before me.'"

From His fullness, we have all received grace upon grace.

For the law was given through Moses; grace and truth came through Jesus Christ.

No one has ever seen God, but the one and only Son, who is Himself God and is in closest relationship with the Father, has made Him known.

This was John's testimony when the Jewish leaders in Jerusalem sent priests and Levites to ask him who he was.

He did not fail to confess, but confessed freely, "I am not the Messiah."

They asked him, "Then who are you? Are you Elijah?"

He said, "I am not."

"Are you the Prophet?" He answered, "No."

Finally, they said, "Who are you? Give us an answer to take back to those who sent us. What do you say about yourself?"

John replied in the words of Isaiah the prophet, "I am the voice of one calling in the wilderness, 'Make straight the way for the Lord.'"

Now the Pharisees who had been sent questioned him, "Why then do you baptize if you are not the Messiah, nor Elijah, nor the Prophet?"

"I baptize with water," John replied, "but among you stands one you do not know.

He is the one who comes after me, the straps of whose sandals I am not worthy to untie."

This all happened at Bethany on the other side of the Jordan, where John was baptizing.

The next day John saw Jesus coming toward him and said, "Look, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world!

This is the one I meant when I said, 'A man who comes after me has surpassed me because He was before me.'

I myself did not know Him, but the reason I came baptizing with water was that He might be revealed to Israel."

Then John gave this testimony: "I saw the Spirit come down from heaven as a dove and remain on Him.

And I myself did not know Him, but the one who sent me to baptize with water told me, 'The man on whom you see the Spirit come down and remain is the one who will baptize with the Holy Spirit.'

I have seen and I testify that this is God's Chosen One."

The next day John was there again with two of his disciples.

When he saw Jesus passing by, he said, "Look, the Lamb of God!"

When the two disciples heard him say this, they followed Jesus.

Turning around, Jesus saw them following and asked, "What do you want?"

They said, "Rabbi" (which means "Teacher"), "where are you staying?"

"Come," He replied, "and you will see."

So they went and saw where He was staying, and they spent that day with Him.

It was about four in the afternoon.

Andrew, Simon Peter's brother, was one of the two who heard what John had said and who had followed Jesus.

The first thing Andrew did was to find his brother Simon and tell him, "We have found the Messiah" (that is, the Christ).

And he brought him to Jesus.

Jesus looked at him and said, "You are Simon son of John.

You will be called Cephas" (which, when translated, is Peter).

The next day Jesus decided to leave for Galilee.

Finding Philip, He said to him, "Follow me."

Philip, like Andrew and Peter, was from the town of Bethsaida.

Philip found Nathanael and told him, "We have found the one Moses wrote about in the Law, and about whom the prophets also wrote--Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph."

"Nazareth! Can anything good come from there?" Nathanael asked.

"Come and see," said Philip.

When Jesus saw Nathanael approaching, He said of him, "Here truly is an Israelite in whom there is no deceit."

"How do you know me?" Nathanael asked.

Jesus answered, "I saw you while you were still under the fig tree before Philip called you."

Then Nathanael declared, "Rabbi, you are the Son of God; you are the king of Israel."

Jesus said, "You believe because I told you I saw you under the fig tree.

You will see greater things than that."

He then added, "Very truly I tell you, you will see heaven open, and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of Man."

## John 2

On the third day, there was a wedding in Cana of Galilee, and Jesus' mother was there.

Jesus and his disciples were also invited to the wedding.

When the wine ran out, Jesus' mother told him, "They have no wine."

Jesus replied, "Why are you involving me, woman? My time has not yet come."

His mother told the servants, "Do whatever he tells you."

There were six stone water jars there, used for the Jewish purification rituals, each holding twenty to thirty gallons.

Jesus told the servants, "Fill the jars with water," and they filled them to the brim.

Then he said, "Now draw some out and take it to the master of the banquet."

They did so, and the master of the banquet tasted the water that had been turned into wine.

He did not know where it had come from, though the servants who had drawn the water knew.

He called the bridegroom aside and said, "Everyone brings out the choice wine first and then the cheaper wine after the guests have had too much to drink; but you have saved the best till now."

This was the first of the signs Jesus performed in Cana of Galilee, and it revealed his glory, and his disciples believed in him.

After this, he went down to Capernaum with his mother, brothers, and disciples, and they stayed there for a few days.

When it was almost time for the Jewish Passover, Jesus went up to Jerusalem.

In the temple courts, he found people selling cattle, sheep, and doves, and others sitting at tables exchanging money.

So he made a whip out of cords and drove all from the temple courts, both sheep and cattle; he scattered the coins of the money changers and overturned their tables.

To those who sold doves, he said, "Get these out of here! Stop turning my Father's house into a market!"

His disciples remembered that it is written: "Zeal for your house will consume me."

The Jews then responded to him, "What sign can you show us to prove your authority to do all this?"

Jesus answered them, "Destroy this temple, and I will raise it again in three days."

They replied, "It has taken forty-six years to build this temple, and you are going to raise it in three days?"

But the temple he had spoken of was his body.

After he was raised from the dead, his disciples recalled what he had said.

Then they believed the scripture and the words that Jesus had spoken.

While he was in Jerusalem at the Passover Festival, many people saw the signs he was performing and believed in his name.

But Jesus would not entrust himself to them, for he knew all people.

He did not need any testimony about mankind, for he knew what was in each person.

## John 3

There was a man named Nicodemus, a Pharisee and a leader of the Jews.

He came to Jesus at night and said, "Teacher, we know you have come from God because no one can do the miracles you do unless God is with him."

Jesus replied, "Truly, I tell you, unless someone is born again, they cannot see the kingdom of God."

Nicodemus asked, "How can someone be born when they are old? Can they enter their mother's womb a second time?"

Jesus answered, "Truly, I tell you, unless someone is born of water and the Spirit, they cannot enter the kingdom of God.

What is born of the flesh is flesh, and what is born of the Spirit is spirit.

Don't be surprised that I said you must be born again.

The wind blows where it wants, and you hear its sound, but you don't know where it comes from or where it goes.

So it is with everyone born of the Spirit."

Nicodemus asked, "How can this be?"

Jesus replied, "You are a teacher of Israel, and you don't understand these things?

Truly, I tell you, we speak of what we know and testify to what we have seen, but you do not accept our testimony.

If I have told you earthly things and you do not believe, how will you believe if I tell you heavenly things?

No one has ascended to heaven except the one who came down from heaven, the Son of Man.

Just as Moses lifted up the snake in the wilderness, so must the Son of Man be lifted up, so that everyone who believes in him may have eternal life.

For God loved the world so much that he gave his only Son, so that everyone who believes in him will not perish but have eternal life.

God did not send his Son into the world to condemn it, but to save it through him.

Whoever believes in him is not condemned, but whoever does not believe is already condemned because they have not believed in the name of God's only Son.

This is the judgment: the light has come into the world, but people loved darkness instead of light because their deeds were evil.

Everyone who does evil hates the light and does not come to the light for fear that their deeds will be exposed.

But whoever lives by the truth comes to the light, so that it may be seen that their deeds have been done in God.

After this, Jesus and his disciples went to the Judean countryside, where he spent some time with them and baptized.

John was also baptizing at Aenon near Salim because there was plenty of water, and people were coming and being baptized.

John had not yet been put in prison.

An argument developed between some of John's disciples and a certain Jew over ceremonial washing.

They came to John and said, "Rabbi, the man who was with you on the other side of the Jordan, the one you testified about, is baptizing, and everyone is going to him."

John replied, "A person can receive only what is given them from heaven.

You yourselves can testify that I said, 'I am not the Messiah but am sent ahead of him.'

The bride belongs to the bridegroom.

The friend who attends the bridegroom waits and listens for him and is full of joy when he hears the bridegroom's voice.

That joy is mine, and it is now complete.

He must become greater; I must become less.

The one who comes from above is above all; the one who is from the earth belongs to the earth and speaks as one from the earth.

The one who comes from heaven is above all.

He testifies to what he has seen and heard, but no one accepts his testimony.

Whoever has accepted it has certified that God is truthful.

For the one whom God has sent speaks the words of God, for God gives the Spirit without limit.

The Father loves the Son and has placed everything in his hands.

Whoever believes in the Son has eternal life, but whoever rejects the Son will not see life, for God's wrath remains on them.

## John 4

When Jesus found out that the Pharisees heard he was making and baptizing more disciples than John, he left Judea and went back to Galilee.

He had to go through Samaria, and he came to a town called Sychar, near the land Jacob gave to his son Joseph.

Jacob's well was there, and Jesus, tired from his journey, sat by the well.

It was about noon.

A Samaritan woman came to draw water, and Jesus asked her, "Give me a drink."

His disciples had gone into town to buy food.

The woman said, "How can you, a Jew, ask me, a Samaritan woman, for a drink?"

Jews didn't associate with Samaritans.

Jesus answered, "If you knew the gift of God and who is asking you for a drink, you would have asked him, and he would have given you living water."

The woman said, "Sir, you have nothing to draw with, and the well is deep.

Where can you get this living water?

Are you greater than our father Jacob, who gave us the well and drank from it himself, as did his sons and livestock?"

Jesus said, "Everyone who drinks this water will be thirsty again, but whoever drinks the water I give them will never thirst.

Indeed, the water I give will become a spring of water welling up to eternal life."

The woman said, "Sir, give me this water so I won't get thirsty and have to keep coming here to draw water."

He told her, "Go, call your husband and come back."

"I have no husband," she replied.

Jesus said, "You are right when you say you have no husband.

The fact is, you have had five husbands, and the man you now have is not your husband.

What you have just said is quite true."

"Sir," the woman said, "I can see that you are a prophet.

Our ancestors worshiped on this mountain, but you Jews claim that the place where we must worship is in Jerusalem."

Jesus replied, "Believe me, a time is coming when you will worship the Father neither on this mountain nor in Jerusalem.

You Samaritans worship what you do not know; we worship what we do know, for salvation is from the Jews.

Yet a time is coming and has now come when the true worshipers will worship the Father in the Spirit and in truth, for they are the kind of worshipers the Father seeks.

God is spirit, and his worshipers must worship in the Spirit and in truth."

The woman said, "I know that Messiah" (called Christ) "is coming.

When he comes, he will explain everything to us."

Then Jesus declared, "I, the one speaking to you--I am he."

Just then his disciples returned and were surprised to find him talking with a woman.

But no one asked, "What do you want?" or "Why are you talking with her?"

Then, leaving her water jar, the woman went back to the town and said to the people, "Come, see a man who told me everything I ever did.

Could this be the Messiah?"

They came out of the town and made their way toward him.

Meanwhile, his disciples urged him, "Rabbi, eat something."

But he said to them, "I have food to eat that you know nothing about."

Then his disciples said to each other, "Could someone have brought him food?"

"My food," said Jesus, "is to do the will of him who sent me and to finish his work.

Don't you have a saying, 'It's still four months until harvest'?

I tell you, open your eyes and look at the fields!

They are ripe for harvest.

Even now the one who reaps draws a wage and harvests a crop for eternal life, so that the sower and the reaper may be glad together.

Thus the saying 'One sows and another reaps' is true.

I sent you to reap what you have not worked for.

Others have done the hard work, and you have reaped the benefits of their labor."

Many of the Samaritans from that town believed in him because of the woman's testimony, "He told me everything I ever did."

So when the Samaritans came to him, they urged him to stay with them, and he stayed two days.

And because of his words, many more became believers.

They said to the woman, "We no longer believe just because of what you said; now we have heard for ourselves, and we know that this man really is the Savior of the world."

After the two days, he left for Galilee.

(Now Jesus himself had pointed out that a prophet has no honor in his own country.)

When he arrived in Galilee, the Galileans welcomed him.

They had seen all that he had done in Jerusalem at the Passover Festival, for they also had been there.

Once more he visited Cana in Galilee, where he had turned the water into wine.

And there was a certain royal official whose son lay sick at Capernaum.

When this man heard that Jesus had arrived in Galilee from Judea, he went to him and begged him to come and heal his son, who was close to death.

"Unless you people see signs and wonders," Jesus told him, "you will never believe."

The royal official said, "Sir, come down before my child dies."

"Go," Jesus replied, "your son will live."

The man took Jesus at his word and departed.

While he was still on the way, his servants met him with the news that his boy was living.

When he inquired as to the time when his son got better, they said to him, "Yesterday, at one in the afternoon, the fever left him."

Then the father realized that this was the exact time at which Jesus had said to him, "Your son will live."

So he and his whole household believed.

This was the second sign Jesus performed after coming from Judea to Galilee.

## John 5

After this, there was a Jewish festival, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.

In Jerusalem, there was a pool called Bethesda in Hebrew, which had five porches.

Many sick people, blind, lame, and paralyzed, were lying there.

There was a man who had been sick for thirty-eight years.

Jesus saw him lying there and knew he had been sick for a long time, so he asked him, "Do you want to get well?"

The sick man replied, "Sir, I have no one to help me into the pool when the water is stirred.

While I'm trying to get in, someone else goes down ahead of me."

Jesus said to him, "Get up, pick up your mat, and walk."

Immediately, the man was healed, picked up his mat, and walked.

This happened on a Sabbath day.

The Jewish leaders said to the man who had been healed, "It's the Sabbath; you shouldn't be carrying your mat."

But he replied, "The man who healed me told me to pick up my mat and walk."

They asked him, "Who is this man who told you to pick it up and walk?"

But the man who was healed didn't know who it was, because Jesus had slipped away into the crowd.

Later, Jesus found him in the temple and said, "See, you are well again.

Stop sinning or something worse may happen to you."

The man went away and told the Jewish leaders that it was Jesus who had made him well.

Because of this, the Jewish leaders began to persecute Jesus, because he was doing these things on the Sabbath.

But Jesus said to them, "My Father is always at work, and I too am working."

This made the Jewish leaders even more determined to kill him, because not only was he breaking the Sabbath, but he was also calling God his own Father, making himself equal with God.

Jesus gave them this answer: "Truly, I tell you, the Son can do nothing by himself; he can only do what he sees his Father doing, because whatever the Father does, the Son also does.

For the Father loves the Son and shows him all he does.

Yes, and he will show him even greater works than these, so that you will be amazed.

For just as the Father raises the dead and gives them life, even so the Son gives life to whom he is pleased to give it.

Moreover, the Father judges no one, but has entrusted all judgment to the Son, that all may honor the Son just as they honor the Father.

Whoever does not honor the Son does not honor the Father who sent him.

"Truly, I tell you, whoever hears my word and believes him who sent me has eternal life and will not be judged but has crossed over from death to life.

Truly, I tell you, a time is coming and has now come when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God and those who hear will live.

For as the Father has life in himself, so he has granted the Son also to have life in himself.

And he has given him authority to judge because he is the Son of Man.

"Do not be amazed at this, for a time is coming when all who are in their graves will hear his voice and come out--those who have done good will rise to live, and those who have done evil will rise to be condemned.

By myself, I can do nothing; I judge only as I hear, and my judgment is just, for I seek not to please myself but him who sent me.

"If I testify about myself, my testimony is not true.

There is another who testifies in my favor, and I know that his testimony about me is true.

You have sent to John and he has testified to the truth.

Not that I accept human testimony, but I mention it that you may be saved.

John was a lamp that burned and gave light, and you chose for a time to enjoy his light.

"I have testimony weightier than that of John.

For the works that the Father has given me to finish--the very works that I am doing--testify that the Father has sent me.

And the Father who sent me has himself testified concerning me.

You have never heard his voice nor seen his form, nor does his word dwell in you, for you do not believe the one he sent.

"You study the Scriptures diligently because you think that in them you have eternal life.

These are the very Scriptures that testify about me, yet you refuse to come to me to have life.

I do not accept glory from human beings, but I know you.

I know that you do not have the love of God in your hearts.

I have come in my Father's name, and you do not accept me; but if someone else comes in his own name, you will accept him.

"How can you believe since you accept glory from one another but do not seek the glory that comes from the only God?

But do not think I will accuse you before the Father.

Your accuser is Moses, on whom your hopes are set.

If you believed Moses, you would believe me, for he wrote about me.

But since you do not believe what he wrote, how are you going to believe what I say?

## John 6

After this, Jesus went across the Sea of Galilee, also known as the Sea of Tiberias.

A large crowd followed him because they saw the miracles he performed on the sick.

Jesus went up a mountain and sat there with his disciples.

It was almost time for the Jewish Passover festival.

When Jesus looked up and saw a large crowd coming toward him, he asked Philip, "Where can we buy bread for these people to eat?"

He asked this to test Philip, because he already knew what he was going to do.

Philip answered, "Even if we had two hundred silver coins, it wouldn't be enough to buy bread for everyone to have a little."

Another disciple, Andrew, Simon Peter's brother, said, "Here is a boy with five small barley loaves and two small fish, but how far will they go among so many?"

Jesus said, "Have the people sit down."

There was plenty of grass there, and they sat down.

About five thousand men were there.

Jesus took the loaves, gave thanks, and distributed them to those who were seated, as much as they wanted.

He did the same with the fish.

When they had all had enough to eat, he said to his disciples, "Gather the pieces that are left over. Let nothing be wasted."

So they gathered them and filled twelve baskets with the pieces of the five barley loaves left over by those who had eaten.

After the people saw the sign Jesus performed, they began to say, "Surely this is the Prophet who is to come into the world."

Jesus, knowing that they intended to come and make him king by force, withdrew again to a mountain by himself.

When evening came, his disciples went down to the lake, where they got into a boat and set off across the lake for Capernaum.

By now it was dark, and Jesus had not yet joined them.

A strong wind was blowing, and the waters grew rough.

When they had rowed about three or four miles, they saw Jesus approaching the boat, walking on the water, and they were frightened.

But he said to them, "It is I; don't be afraid."

Then they were willing to take him into the boat, and immediately the boat reached the shore where they were heading.

The next day the crowd that had stayed on the opposite shore of the lake realized that only one boat had been there, and that Jesus had not entered it with his disciples, but that they had gone away alone.

Then some boats from Tiberias landed near the place where the people had eaten the bread after the Lord had given thanks.

Once the crowd realized that neither Jesus nor his disciples were there, they got into the boats and went to Capernaum in search of Jesus.

When they found him on the other side of the lake, they asked him, "Rabbi, when did you get here?"

Jesus answered, "Very truly I tell you, you are looking for me, not because you saw the signs I performed but because you ate the loaves and had your fill.

Do not work for food that spoils, but for food that endures to eternal life, which the Son of Man will give you.

For on him God the Father has placed his seal of approval."

Then they asked him, "What must we do to do the works God requires?"

Jesus answered, "The work of God is this: to believe in the one he has sent."

So they asked him, "What sign then will you give that we may see it and believe you? What will you do?

Our ancestors ate the manna in the wilderness; as it is written: 'He gave them bread from heaven to eat.'"

Jesus said to them, "Very truly I tell you, it is not Moses who has given you the bread from heaven, but it is my Father who gives you the true bread from heaven.

For the bread of God is the bread that comes down from heaven and gives life to the world."

"Sir," they said, "always give us this bread."

Then Jesus declared, "I am the bread of life.

Whoever comes to me will never go hungry, and whoever believes in me will never be thirsty.

But as I told you, you have seen me and still you do not believe.

All those the Father gives me will come to me, and whoever comes to me I will never drive away.

For I have come down from heaven not to do my will but to do the will of him who sent me.

And this is the will of him who sent me, that I shall lose none of all those he has given me, but raise them up at the last day.

For my Father's will is that everyone who looks to the Son and believes in him shall have eternal life, and I will raise them up at the last day."

At this the Jews there began to grumble about him because he said, "I am the bread that came down from heaven."

They said, "Is this not Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know?

How can he now say, 'I came down from heaven'?"

"Stop grumbling among yourselves," Jesus answered.

"No one can come to me unless the Father who sent me draws them, and I will raise them up at the last day.

It is written in the Prophets: 'They will all be taught by God.'

Everyone who has heard the Father and learned from him comes to me.

No one has seen the Father except the one who is from God; only he has seen the Father.

Very truly I tell you, the one who believes has eternal life.

I am the bread of life.

Your ancestors ate the manna in the wilderness, yet they died.

But here is the bread that comes down from heaven, which anyone may eat and not die.

I am the living bread that came down from heaven.

Whoever eats this bread will live forever.

This bread is my flesh, which I will give for the life of the world."

Then the Jews began to argue sharply among themselves, "How can this man give us his flesh to eat?"

Jesus said to them, "Very truly I tell you, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood, you have no life in you.

Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life, and I will raise them up at the last day.

For my flesh is real food and my blood is real drink.

Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood remains in me, and I in them.

Just as the living Father sent me and I live because of the Father, so the one who feeds on me will live because of me.

This is the bread that came down from heaven.

Your ancestors ate manna and died, but whoever feeds on this bread will live forever."

He said this while teaching in the synagogue in Capernaum.

On hearing it, many of his disciples said, "This is a hard teaching.

Who can accept it?"

Aware that his disciples were grumbling about this, Jesus said to them, "Does this offend you?

Then what if you see the Son of Man ascend to where he was before!

The Spirit gives life; the flesh counts for nothing.

The words I have spoken to you--they are full of the Spirit and life.

Yet there are some of you who do not believe."

For Jesus had known from the beginning which of them did not believe and who would betray him.

He went on to say, "This is why I told you that no one can come to me unless the Father has enabled them."

From this time many of his disciples turned back and no longer followed him.

"You do not want to leave too, do you?" Jesus asked the Twelve.

Simon Peter answered him, "Lord, to whom shall we go?

You have the words of eternal life.

We have come to believe and to know that you are the Holy One of God."

Then Jesus replied, "Have I not chosen you, the Twelve?

Yet one of you is a devil!"

(He meant Judas, the son of Simon Iscariot, who, though one of the Twelve, was later to betray him.)

## John 7

After this, Jesus was walking around in Galilee.

He didn't want to go to Judea because the Jewish leaders were trying to kill him.

The Jewish festival of Tabernacles was near, so his brothers said to him, "Leave here and go to Judea so your followers can see the works you do.

No one who wants to be known does things in secret.

If you do these things, show yourself to the world."

Even his brothers didn't believe in him.

Jesus told them, "My time hasn't come yet, but your time is always ready.

The world can't hate you, but it hates me because I tell it that its works are evil.

You go to the festival; I'm not going yet because my time hasn't fully come."

After saying this, he stayed in Galilee.

But after his brothers went to the festival, he also went, not openly, but secretly.

The Jewish leaders were looking for him at the festival and asking, "Where is he?"

There was a lot of whispering about him among the crowds.

Some said, "He's a good man," while others said, "No, he deceives the people."

But no one spoke openly about him because they were afraid of the Jewish leaders.

Halfway through the festival, Jesus went to the temple and began to teach.

The Jewish leaders were amazed and asked, "How did this man get such learning without having been taught?"

Jesus answered, "My teaching is not my own.

It comes from the one who sent me.

If anyone chooses to do God's will, they will find out whether my teaching comes from God or whether I speak on my own.

Whoever speaks on their own does so to gain personal glory, but he who seeks the glory of the one who sent him is a man of truth; there is nothing false about him.

Hasn't Moses given you the law?

Yet not one of you keeps the law.

Why are you trying to kill me?"

The crowd answered, "You are demon-possessed.

Who is trying to kill you?"

Jesus said, "I did one miracle, and you are all amazed.

Yet, because Moses gave you circumcision (though actually it did not come from Moses, but from the patriarchs), you circumcise a boy on the Sabbath.

Now if a boy can be circumcised on the Sabbath so that the law of Moses may not be broken, why are you angry with me for healing a man's whole body on the Sabbath?

Stop judging by mere appearances, but instead judge correctly."

Some of the people of Jerusalem began to ask, "Isn't this the man they are trying to kill?

Here he is, speaking publicly, and they are not saying a word to him.

Have the authorities really concluded that he is the Messiah?

But we know where this man is from; when the Messiah comes, no one will know where he is from."

Then Jesus, still teaching in the temple courts, cried out, "Yes, you know me, and you know where I am from.

I am not here on my own authority, but he who sent me is true.

You do not know him, but I know him because I am from him and he sent me."

At this, they tried to seize him, but no one laid a hand on him because his hour had not yet come.

Still, many in the crowd believed in him.

They said, "When the Messiah comes, will he perform more signs than this man?"

The Pharisees heard the crowd whispering such things about him.

Then the chief priests and the Pharisees sent temple guards to arrest him.

Jesus said, "I am with you for only a short time, and then I am going to the one who sent me.

You will look for me, but you will not find me; and where I am, you cannot come."

The Jews said to one another, "Where does this man intend to go that we cannot find him?

Will he go where our people live scattered among the Greeks, and teach the Greeks?

What did he mean when he said, 'You will look for me, but you will not find me,' and 'Where I am, you cannot come'?"

On the last and greatest day of the festival, Jesus stood and said in a loud voice, "Let anyone who is thirsty come to me and drink.

Whoever believes in me, as Scripture has said, rivers of living water will flow from within them."

By this, he meant the Spirit, whom those who believed in him were later to receive.

Up to that time, the Spirit had not been given, since Jesus had not yet been glorified.

On hearing his words, some of the people said, "Surely this man is the Prophet."

Others said, "He is the Messiah."

Still others asked, "How can the Messiah come from Galilee?

Doesn't Scripture say that the Messiah will come from David's descendants and from Bethlehem, the town where David lived?"

Thus the people were divided because of Jesus.

Some wanted to seize him, but no one laid a hand on him.

Finally, the temple guards went back to the chief priests and the Pharisees, who asked them, "Why didn't you bring him in?"

"No one ever spoke the way this man does," the guards replied.

"You mean he has deceived you also?" the Pharisees retorted.

"Have any of the rulers or of the Pharisees believed in him?

No!

But this mob that knows nothing of the law--there is a curse on them."

Nicodemus, who had gone to Jesus earlier and who was one of their own number, asked, "Does our law condemn a man without first hearing him to find out what he has been doing?"

They replied, "Are you from Galilee, too?

Look into it, and you will find that a prophet does not come out of Galilee."

Then they all went home.

## John 8

Jesus went to the Mount of Olives.

Early in the morning, he returned to the temple, and all the people came to him, and he sat down and taught them.

The scribes and Pharisees brought a woman caught in adultery and made her stand in the middle.

They said to him, "Teacher, this woman was caught in the act of adultery.

In the law, Moses commanded us to stone such women.

What do you say?"

They said this to test him, so they might have something to accuse him of.

But Jesus bent down and wrote on the ground with his finger.

When they kept questioning him, he straightened up and said to them, "Let any one of you who is without sin be the first to throw a stone at her."

Again he stooped down and wrote on the ground.

Those who heard began to go away one at a time, the older ones first, until only Jesus was left, with the woman still standing there.

Jesus straightened up and asked her, "Woman, where are they? Has no one condemned you?"

"No one, sir," she said.

"Then neither do I condemn you," Jesus declared.

"Go now and leave your life of sin."

Jesus spoke to the people again, saying, "I am the light of the world.

Whoever follows me will never walk in darkness, but will have the light of life."

The Pharisees challenged him, "Here you are, appearing as your own witness; your testimony is not valid."

Jesus answered, "Even if I testify on my own behalf, my testimony is valid, for I know where I came from and where I am going.

But you have no idea where I come from or where I am going.

You judge by human standards; I pass judgment on no one.

But if I do judge, my decisions are true, because I am not alone.

I stand with the Father, who sent me.

In your own Law it is written that the testimony of two witnesses is true.

I am one who testifies for myself; my other witness is the Father, who sent me."

Then they asked him, "Where is your father?"

"You do not know me or my Father," Jesus replied.

"If you knew me, you would know my Father also."

He spoke these words while teaching in the temple courts near the place where the offerings were put.

Yet no one seized him, because his hour had not yet come.

Once more Jesus said to them, "I am going away, and you will look for me, and you will die in your sin.

Where I go, you cannot come."

This made the Jews ask, "Will he kill himself? Is that why he says, 'Where I go, you cannot come'?"

But he continued, "You are from below; I am from above.

You are of this world; I am not of this world.

I told you that you would die in your sins; if you do not believe that I am he, you will indeed die in your sins."

"Who are you?" they asked.

"Just what I have been telling you from the beginning," Jesus replied.

"I have much to say in judgment of you.

But he who sent me is trustworthy, and what I have heard from him I tell the world."

They did not understand that he was telling them about his Father.

So Jesus said, "When you have lifted up the Son of Man, then you will know that I am he and that I do nothing on my own but speak just what the Father has taught me.

The one who sent me is with me; he has not left me alone, for I always do what pleases him."

Even as he spoke, many believed in him.

To the Jews who had believed him, Jesus said, "If you hold to my teaching, you are really my disciples.

Then you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free."

They answered him, "We are Abraham's descendants and have never been slaves of anyone.

How can you say that we shall be set free?"

Jesus replied, "Very truly I tell you, everyone who sins is a slave to sin.

Now a slave has no permanent place in the family, but a son belongs to it forever.

So if the Son sets you free, you will be free indeed.

I know that you are Abraham's descendants.

Yet you are looking for a way to kill me, because you have no room for my word.

I am telling you what I have seen in the Father's presence, and you are doing what you have heard from your father."

"Abraham is our father," they answered.

"If you were Abraham's children," said Jesus, "then you would do what Abraham did.

As it is, you are looking for a way to kill me, a man who has told you the truth that I heard from God.

Abraham did not do such things.

You are doing the works of your own father."

"We are not illegitimate children," they protested.

"The only Father we have is God himself."

Jesus said to them, "If God were your Father, you would love me, for I have come here from God.

I have not come on my own; God sent me.

Why is my language not clear to you?

Because you are unable to hear what I say.

You belong to your father, the devil, and you want to carry out your father's desires.

He was a murderer from the beginning, not holding to the truth, for there is no truth in him.

When he lies, he speaks his native language, for he is a liar and the father of lies.

Yet because I tell the truth, you do not believe me!

Can any of you prove me guilty of sin?

If I am telling the truth, why don't you believe me?

Whoever belongs to God hears what God says.

The reason you do not hear is that you do not belong to God."

The Jews answered him, "Aren't we right in saying that you are a Samaritan and demon-possessed?"

"I am not possessed by a demon," said Jesus, "but I honor my Father and you dishonor me.

I am not seeking glory for myself; but there is one who seeks it, and he is the judge.

Very truly I tell you, whoever obeys my word will never see death."

At this they exclaimed, "Now we know that you are demon-possessed!

Abraham died and so did the prophets, yet you say that whoever obeys your word will never taste death.

Are you greater than our father Abraham?

He died, and so did the prophets.

Who do you think you are?"

Jesus replied, "If I glorify myself, my glory means nothing.

My Father, whom you claim as your God, is the one who glorifies me.

Though you do not know him, I know him.

If I said I did not, I would be a liar like you, but I do know him and obey his word.

Your father Abraham rejoiced at the thought of seeing my day; he saw it and was glad."

"You are not yet fifty years old," they said to him, "and you have seen Abraham!"

"Very truly I tell you," Jesus answered, "before Abraham was born, I am!"

At this, they picked up stones to stone him, but Jesus hid himself, slipping away from the temple grounds.

## John 9

Jesus saw a man who was blind from birth.

His disciples asked him, "Teacher, who sinned, this man or his parents, that he was born blind?"

Jesus answered, "Neither this man nor his parents sinned, but this happened so that the works of God might be displayed in him.

We must do the works of him who sent me while it is day.

Night is coming, when no one can work.

While I am in the world, I am the light of the world."

After saying this, he spit on the ground, made some mud with the saliva, and put it on the man's eyes.

"Go," he told him, "wash in the Pool of Siloam" (this word means "Sent").

So the man went and washed, and came home seeing.

His neighbors and those who had seen him begging asked, "Isn't this the same man who used to sit and beg?"

Some claimed that he was.

Others said, "No, he only looks like him."

But he himself insisted, "I am the man."

"How then were your eyes opened?" they asked.

He replied, "The man they call Jesus made some mud and put it on my eyes.

He told me to go to Siloam and wash.

So I went and washed, and then I could see."

"Where is this man?" they asked him.

"I don't know," he said.

They brought to the Pharisees the man who had been blind.

Now the day on which Jesus had made the mud and opened the man's eyes was a Sabbath.

Therefore the Pharisees also asked him how he had received his sight.

"He put mud on my eyes," the man replied, "and I washed, and now I see."

Some of the Pharisees said, "This man is not from God, for he does not keep the Sabbath."

But others asked, "How can a sinner perform such signs?"

So they were divided.

Then they turned again to the blind man, "What have you to say about him? It was your eyes he opened."

The man replied, "He is a prophet."

They still did not believe that he had been blind and had received his sight until they sent for the man's parents.

"Is this your son?" they asked.

"Is this the one you say was born blind? How is it that now he can see?"

"We know he is our son," the parents answered, "and we know he was born blind.

But how he can see now, or who opened his eyes, we don't know.

Ask him.

He is of age; he will speak for himself."

His parents said this because they were afraid of the Jewish leaders, who already had decided that anyone who acknowledged that Jesus was the Messiah would be put out of the synagogue.

That was why his parents said, "He is of age; ask him."

A second time they summoned the man who had been blind.

"Give glory to God by telling the truth," they said.

"We know this man is a sinner."

He replied, "Whether he is a sinner or not, I don't know.

One thing I do know.

I was blind but now I see!"

Then they asked him, "What did he do to you? How did he open your eyes?"

He answered, "I have told you already and you did not listen.

Why do you want to hear it again?

Do you want to become his disciples too?"

Then they hurled insults at him and said, "You are this fellow's disciple!

We are disciples of Moses!

We know that God spoke to Moses, but as for this fellow, we don't even know where he comes from."

The man answered, "Now that is remarkable!

You don't know where he comes from, yet he opened my eyes.

We know that God does not listen to sinners.

He listens to the godly person who does his will.

Nobody has ever heard of opening the eyes of a man born blind.

If this man were not from God, he could do nothing."

To this they replied, "You were steeped in sin at birth; how dare you lecture us!"

And they threw him out.

Jesus heard that they had thrown him out, and when he found him, he said, "Do you believe in the Son of Man?"

"Who is he, sir?" the man asked.

"Tell me so that I may believe in him."

Jesus said, "You have now seen him; in fact, he is the one speaking with you."

Then the man said, "Lord, I believe," and he worshiped him.

Jesus said, "For judgment I have come into this world, so that the blind will see and those who see will become blind."

Some Pharisees who were with him heard him say this and asked, "What? Are we blind too?"

Jesus said, "If you were blind, you would not be guilty of sin; but now that you claim you can see, your guilt remains."

## John 10

Truly, truly, I say to you, anyone who doesn't enter by the gate into the sheepfold, but climbs in another way, that person is a thief and a robber.

But the one who enters by the gate is the shepherd of the sheep.

The gatekeeper opens the gate for him, and the sheep listen to his voice.

He calls his own sheep by name and leads them out.

When he has brought out all his own, he goes ahead of them, and the sheep follow him because they recognize his voice.

They won't follow a stranger, but will run away, because they don't know the stranger's voice.

Jesus spoke this parable to them, but they didn't understand what he meant.

So Jesus said again, "Truly, truly, I tell you, I am the gate for the sheep.

All who came before me are thieves and robbers, but the sheep didn't listen to them.

I am the gate.

If anyone enters through me, they will be saved and will come in and go out and find pasture.

The thief only comes to steal, kill, and destroy.

I have come so that they may have life and have it abundantly.

I am the good shepherd.

The good shepherd gives his life for the sheep.

A hired hand, who is not the shepherd and doesn't own the sheep, sees the wolf coming, leaves the sheep, and runs away.

The wolf snatches them and scatters the flock.

The hired hand runs away because he is only hired and doesn't care about the sheep.

I am the good shepherd.

I know my sheep, and my sheep know me, just as the Father knows me, and I know the Father.

I lay down my life for the sheep.

I have other sheep that are not in this sheep pen.

I must bring them also, and they will listen to my voice.

There will be one flock and one shepherd.

This is why the Father loves me, because I lay down my life so that I may take it up again.

No one takes it from me, but I lay it down of my own accord.

I have the authority to lay it down and the authority to take it up again.

I received this charge from my Father.

There was another division among the Jews because of these words.

Many of them said, "He has a demon and is mad.

Why listen to him?"

Others said, "These aren't the words of a demon-possessed person.

Can a demon open the eyes of the blind?"

Then came the Feast of Dedication at Jerusalem in winter.

Jesus was walking in the temple in Solomon's porch.

The Jews surrounded him, asking, "How long will you keep us in suspense?

If you are the Christ, tell us plainly."

Jesus replied, "I told you, but you do not believe.

The works I do in my Father's name testify of me.

But you do not believe because you are not my sheep.

My sheep hear my voice, I know them, and they follow me.

I give them eternal life, and they shall never perish.

No one will snatch them out of my hand.

My Father, who has given them to me, is greater than all.

No one can snatch them from my Father's hand.

I and the Father are one."

Once again, the Jews picked up stones to stone him.

Jesus answered them, "I have shown you many good works from the Father.

For which of these do you stone me?"

The Jews answered him, "We're not stoning you for any good work but for blasphemy, because you, a mere man, claim to be God."

Jesus said, "Isn't it written in your law, 'I have said you are gods'?

If he called them 'gods' to whom the word of God came--and Scripture cannot be set aside--what about the one whom the Father set apart as his very own and sent into the world?

Why then do you accuse me of blasphemy because I said, 'I am God's Son'?

If I do not do the works of my Father, don't believe me.

But if I do them, even if you don't believe me, believe the works themselves, so you may know and understand that the Father is in me, and I in the Father."

Therefore, they wanted to seize him again, but he escaped from their grasp.

He went back across the Jordan to the place where John had been baptizing at first, and he stayed there.

Many people came to him, saying, "Though John never performed a sign, all that John said about this man was true."

And many believed in him there.

## John 11

There was a man named Lazarus who was sick.

He was from Bethany, the village of Mary and her sister Martha.

Mary was the one who had poured perfume on the Lord and wiped his feet with her hair.

Lazarus, their brother, was sick.

So the sisters sent a message to Jesus, saying, "Lord, the one you love is sick."

When Jesus heard this, he said, "This sickness will not end in death.

It is for God's glory so that God's Son may be glorified through it."

Jesus loved Martha, her sister, and Lazarus.

When he heard that Lazarus was sick, he stayed where he was for two more days.

Then he said to his disciples, "Let's go back to Judea."

The disciples said, "Rabbi, the Jews were just trying to stone you, and you're going back there?"

Jesus answered, "Aren't there twelve hours of daylight?

Anyone who walks in the daytime will not stumble, for they see by this world's light.

It is when a person walks at night that they stumble, for they have no light."

After he said this, he told them, "Our friend Lazarus has fallen asleep, but I am going there to wake him up."

His disciples replied, "Lord, if he sleeps, he will get better."

Jesus had been speaking of his death, but his disciples thought he meant natural sleep.

So then he told them plainly, "Lazarus is dead, and for your sake, I am glad I was not there, so that you may believe.

But let us go to him."

Then Thomas, also known as Didymus, said to the rest of the disciples, "Let us also go, that we may die with him."

When Jesus arrived, he found that Lazarus had already been in the tomb for four days.

Bethany was less than two miles from Jerusalem, and many Jews had come to Martha and Mary to comfort them in the loss of their brother.

When Martha heard that Jesus was coming, she went out to meet him, but Mary stayed at home.

"Lord," Martha said to Jesus, "if you had been here, my brother would not have died.

But I know that even now God will give you whatever you ask."

Jesus said to her, "Your brother will rise again."

Martha answered, "I know he will rise again in the resurrection at the last day."

Jesus said to her, "I am the resurrection and the life.

The one who believes in me will live, even though they die; and whoever lives by believing in me will never die.

Do you believe this?"

"Yes, Lord," she replied, "I believe that you are the Messiah, the Son of God, who is to come into the world."

After she had said this, she went back and called her sister Mary aside.

"The Teacher is here," she said, "and is asking for you."

When Mary heard this, she got up quickly and went to him.

Now Jesus had not yet entered the village, but was still at the place where Martha had met him.

When the Jews who had been with Mary in the house, comforting her, noticed how quickly she got up and went out, they followed her, supposing she was going to the tomb to mourn there.

When Mary reached the place where Jesus was and saw him, she fell at his feet and said, "Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not have died."

When Jesus saw her weeping, and the Jews who had come along with her also weeping, he was deeply moved in spirit and troubled.

"Where have you laid him?" he asked.

"Come and see, Lord," they replied.

Jesus wept.

Then the Jews said, "See how he loved him!"

But some of them said, "Could not he who opened the eyes of the blind man have kept this man from dying?"

Jesus, once more deeply moved, came to the tomb.

It was a cave with a stone laid across the entrance.

"Take away the stone," he said.

"But, Lord," said Martha, the sister of the dead man, "by this time there is a bad odor, for he has been there four days."

Then Jesus said, "Did I not tell you that if you believe, you will see the glory of God?"

So they took away the stone.

Then Jesus looked up and said, "Father, I thank you that you have heard me.

I knew that you always hear me, but I said this for the benefit of the people standing here, that they may believe that you sent me."

When he had said this, Jesus called in a loud voice, "Lazarus, come out!"

The dead man came out, his hands and feet wrapped with strips of linen, and a cloth around his face.

Jesus said to them, "Take off the grave clothes and let him go."

Therefore many of the Jews who had come to visit Mary, and had seen what Jesus did, believed in him.

But some of them went to the Pharisees and told them what Jesus had done.

Then the chief priests and the Pharisees called a meeting of the Sanhedrin.

"What are we accomplishing?" they asked.

"Here is this man performing many signs.

If we let him go on like this, everyone will believe in him, and then the Romans will come and take away both our temple and our nation."

Then one of them, named Caiaphas, who was high priest that year, spoke up, "You know nothing at all!

You do not realize that it is better for you that one man die for the people than that the whole nation perish."

He did not say this on his own, but as high priest that year he prophesied that Jesus would die for the Jewish nation, and not only for that nation but also for the scattered children of God, to bring them together and make them one.

So from that day on they plotted to take his life.

Therefore Jesus no longer moved about publicly among the people of Judea.

Instead, he withdrew to a region near the wilderness, to a village called Ephraim, where he stayed with his disciples.

When it was almost time for the Jewish Passover, many went up from the country to Jerusalem for their ceremonial cleansing before the Passover.

They kept looking for Jesus, and as they stood in the temple courts they asked one another, "What do you think?

Isn't he coming to the festival at all?"

But the chief priests and the Pharisees had given orders that anyone who found out where Jesus was should report it so that they might arrest him.

## John 12

Six days before the Passover, Jesus went to Bethany where Lazarus, whom Jesus had raised from the dead, lived.

They made a dinner for him there, and Martha served while Lazarus was among those reclining at the table with him.

Mary took a pint of expensive perfume made of pure nard, poured it on Jesus' feet, and wiped his feet with her hair.

The house was filled with the fragrance of the perfume.

But Judas Iscariot, one of his disciples who was later to betray him, objected, "Why wasn't this perfume sold and the money given to the poor?

It was worth a year's wages."

He did not say this because he cared about the poor but because he was a thief; as keeper of the money bag, he used to help himself to what was put into it.

"Leave her alone," Jesus replied.

"It was intended that she should save this perfume for the day of my burial.

You will always have the poor among you, but you will not always have me."

Meanwhile, a large crowd of Jews found out that Jesus was there and came, not only because of him but also to see Lazarus, whom he had raised from the dead.

So the chief priests made plans to kill Lazarus as well, for on account of him many of the Jews were going over to Jesus and believing in him.

The next day the great crowd that had come for the festival heard that Jesus was on his way to Jerusalem.

They took palm branches and went out to meet him, shouting, "Hosanna! Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord! Blessed is the king of Israel!"

Jesus found a young donkey and sat on it, as it is written: "Do not be afraid, Daughter Zion; see, your king is coming, seated on a donkey's colt."

At first, his disciples did not understand all this.

Only after Jesus was glorified did they realize that these things had been written about him and that these things had been done to him.

Now the crowd that was with him when he called Lazarus from the tomb and raised him from the dead continued to spread the word.

Many people, because they had heard that he had performed this sign, went out to meet him.

So the Pharisees said to one another, "See, this is getting us nowhere.

Look how the whole world has gone after him!"

Now there were some Greeks among those who went up to worship at the festival.

They came to Philip, who was from Bethsaida in Galilee, with a request.

"Sir," they said, "we would like to see Jesus."

Philip went to tell Andrew; Andrew and Philip in turn told Jesus.

Jesus replied, "The hour has come for the Son of Man to be glorified.

Very truly I tell you, unless a kernel of wheat falls to the ground and dies, it remains only a single seed.

But if it dies, it produces many seeds.

Anyone who loves their life will lose it, while anyone who hates their life in this world will keep it for eternal life.

Whoever serves me must follow me; and where I am, my servant also will be.

My Father will honor the one who serves me.

"Now my soul is troubled, and what shall I say?

'Father, save me from this hour'?

No, it was for this very reason I came to this hour.

Father, glorify your name!"

Then a voice came from heaven, "I have glorified it, and will glorify it again."

The crowd that was there and heard it said it had thundered; others said an angel had spoken to him.

Jesus said, "This voice was for your benefit, not mine.

Now is the time for judgment on this world; now the prince of this world will be driven out.

And I, when I am lifted up from the earth, will draw all people to myself."

He said this to show the kind of death he was going to die.

The crowd spoke up, "We have heard from the Law that the Messiah will remain forever, so how can you say, 'The Son of Man must be lifted up'?

Who is this 'Son of Man'?"

Then Jesus told them, "You are going to have the light just a little while longer.

Walk while you have the light, before darkness overtakes you.

Whoever walks in the dark does not know where they are going.

Believe in the light while you have the light, so that you may become children of light."

When he had finished speaking, Jesus left and hid himself from them.

Even after Jesus had performed so many signs in their presence, they still would not believe in him.

This was to fulfill the word of Isaiah the prophet: "Lord, who has believed our message and to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed?"

For this reason, they could not believe, because, as Isaiah says elsewhere: "He has blinded their eyes and hardened their hearts, so they can neither see with their eyes, nor understand with their hearts, nor turn--and I would heal them."

Isaiah said this because he saw Jesus' glory and spoke about him.

Yet at the same time many even among the leaders believed in him.

But because of the Pharisees they would not openly acknowledge their faith for fear they would be put out of the synagogue; for they loved human praise more than praise from God.

Then Jesus cried out, "Whoever believes in me does not believe in me only, but in the one who sent me.

The one who looks at me is seeing the one who sent me.

I have come into the world as a light, so that no one who believes in me should stay in darkness.

"If anyone hears my words but does not keep them, I do not judge that person.

For I did not come to judge the world, but to save the world.

There is a judge for the one who rejects me and does not accept my words; the very words I have spoken will condemn them at the last day.

For I did not speak on my own, but the Father who sent me commanded me to say all that I have spoken.

I know that his command leads to eternal life.

So whatever I say is just what the Father has told me to say."

## John 13

Before the Passover festival, Jesus knew that his time had come to leave this world and go to the Father.

He loved his followers in the world and loved them to the end.

During supper, the devil had already put it into the heart of Judas Iscariot, Simon's son, to betray him.

Jesus knew that the Father had given everything into his hands and that he had come from God and was going back to God.

So he got up from the meal, took off his outer clothing, and wrapped a towel around his waist.

After that, he poured water into a basin and began to wash his disciples' feet, drying them with the towel that was wrapped around him.

He came to Simon Peter, who said to him, "Lord, are you going to wash my feet?"

Jesus replied, "You do not realize now what I am doing, but later you will understand."

"No," said Peter, "you shall never wash my feet."

Jesus answered, "Unless I wash you, you have no part with me."

"Then, Lord," Simon Peter replied, "not just my feet but my hands and my head as well!"

Jesus answered, "Those who have had a bath need only to wash their feet; their whole body is clean.

And you are clean, though not every one of you."

For he knew who was going to betray him, and that was why he said not everyone was clean.

When he had finished washing their feet, he put on his clothes and returned to his place.

"Do you understand what I have done for you?" he asked them.

"You call me 'Teacher' and 'Lord,' and rightly so, for that is what I am.

Now that I, your Lord and Teacher, have washed your feet, you also should wash one another's feet.

I have set you an example that you should do as I have done for you.

Very truly I tell you, no servant is greater than his master, nor is a messenger greater than the one who sent him.

Now that you know these things, you will be blessed if you do them.

I am not referring to all of you; I know those I have chosen.

But this is to fulfill this passage of Scripture: 'He who shared my bread has turned against me.'

I am telling you now before it happens, so that when it does happen you will believe that I am who I am.

Very truly I tell you, whoever accepts anyone I send accepts me; and whoever accepts me accepts the one who sent me."

After he had said this, Jesus was troubled in spirit and testified, "Very truly I tell you, one of you is going to betray me."

His disciples stared at one another, at a loss to know which of them he meant.

One of them, the disciple whom Jesus loved, was reclining next to him.

Simon Peter motioned to this disciple and said, "Ask him which one he means."

Leaning back against Jesus, he asked him, "Lord, who is it?"

Jesus answered, "It is the one to whom I will give this piece of bread when I have dipped it in the dish."

Then, dipping the piece of bread, he gave it to Judas, the son of Simon Iscariot.

As soon as Judas took the bread, Satan entered into him.

So Jesus told him, "What you are about to do, do quickly."

But no one at the meal understood why Jesus said this to him.

Since Judas had charge of the money, some thought Jesus was telling him to buy what was needed for the festival, or to give something to the poor.

As soon as Judas had taken the bread, he went out.

And it was night.

When he was gone, Jesus said, "Now the Son of Man is glorified and God is glorified in him.

If God is glorified in him, God will glorify the Son in himself, and will glorify him at once.

My children, I will be with you only a little longer.

You will look for me, and just as I told the Jews, so I tell you now: Where I am going, you cannot come.

A new command I give you: Love one another.

As I have loved you, so you must love one another.

By this everyone will know that you are my disciples, if you love one another."

Simon Peter asked him, "Lord, where are you going?"

Jesus replied, "Where I am going, you cannot follow now, but you will follow later."

Peter asked, "Lord, why can't I follow you now?

I will lay down my life for you."

Then Jesus answered, "Will you really lay down your life for me?

Very truly I tell you, before the rooster crows, you will disown me three times."

## John 14

Don't let your heart be troubled.

Trust in God and trust in me.

In my Father's house, there are many rooms.

If it weren't so, I would have told you.

I'm going to prepare a place for you.

And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come back and take you to be with me so that you may also be where I am.

You know the way to the place where I am going.

Thomas said to him, "Lord, we don't know where you are going, so how can we know the way?"

Jesus answered, "I am the way and the truth and the life.

No one comes to the Father except through me.

If you really know me, you will know my Father as well.

From now on, you do know him and have seen him."

Philip said, "Lord, show us the Father and that will be enough for us."

Jesus answered, "Don't you know me, Philip, even after I have been among you for such a long time?

Anyone who has seen me has seen the Father.

How can you say, 'Show us the Father'?

Don't you believe that I am in the Father, and that the Father is in me?

The words I say to you I do not speak on my own authority.

Rather, it is the Father, living in me, who is doing his work.

Believe me when I say that I am in the Father and the Father is in me; or at least believe on the evidence of the works themselves.

Very truly I tell you, whoever believes in me will do the works I have been doing, and they will do even greater things than these, because I am going to the Father.

And I will do whatever you ask in my name, so that the Father may be glorified in the Son.

You may ask me for anything in my name, and I will do it.

If you love me, keep my commands.

And I will ask the Father, and he will give you another advocate to help you and be with you forever--the Spirit of truth.

The world cannot accept him, because it neither sees him nor knows him.

But you know him, for he lives with you and will be in you.

I will not leave you as orphans; I will come to you.

Before long, the world will not see me anymore, but you will see me.

Because I live, you also will live.

On that day you will realize that I am in my Father, and you are in me, and I am in you.

Whoever has my commands and keeps them is the one who loves me.

The one who loves me will be loved by my Father, and I too will love them and show myself to them.

Then Judas (not Judas Iscariot) said, "But, Lord, why do you intend to show yourself to us and not to the world?"

Jesus replied, "Anyone who loves me will obey my teaching.

My Father will love them, and we will come to them and make our home with them.

Anyone who does not love me will not obey my teaching.

These words you hear are not my own; they belong to the Father who sent me.

All this I have spoken while still with you.

But the Advocate, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name, will teach you all things and will remind you of everything I have said to you.

Peace I leave with you; my peace I give you.

I do not give to you as the world gives.

Do not let your hearts be troubled and do not be afraid.

You heard me say, 'I am going away and I am coming back to you.'

If you loved me, you would be glad that I am going to the Father, for the Father is greater than I.

I have told you now before it happens, so that when it does happen you will believe.

I will not say much more to you, for the prince of this world is coming.

He has no hold over me, but he comes so that the world may learn that I love the Father and do exactly what my Father has commanded me.

Come now; let us leave.

## John 15

I am the true vine, and my Father is the gardener.

Every branch in me that does not bear fruit, He takes away, and every branch that bears fruit, He prunes so that it may bear more fruit.

You are already clean because of the word I have spoken to you.

Remain in me, and I will remain in you.

Just as a branch cannot bear fruit by itself unless it remains in the vine, neither can you unless you remain in me.

I am the vine, you are the branches.

Whoever remains in me and I in them will bear much fruit, for apart from me you can do nothing.

If anyone does not remain in me, they are like a branch that is thrown away and withers; such branches are picked up, thrown into the fire, and burned.

If you remain in me and my words remain in you, ask whatever you wish, and it will be done for you.

This is to my Father's glory, that you bear much fruit, showing yourselves to be my disciples.

As the Father has loved me, so have I loved you.

Now remain in my love.

If you keep my commands, you will remain in my love, just as I have kept my Father's commands and remain in His love.

I have told you this so that my joy may be in you and that your joy may be complete.

My command is this: Love each other as I have loved you.

Greater love has no one than this: to lay down one's life for one's friends.

You are my friends if you do what I command.

I no longer call you servants, because a servant does not know his master's business.

Instead, I have called you friends, for everything that I learned from my Father I have made known to you.

You did not choose me, but I chose you and appointed you so that you might go and bear fruit--fruit that will last--and so that whatever you ask in my name the Father will give you.

This is my command: Love each other.

If the world hates you, keep in mind that it hated me first.

If you belonged to the world, it would love you as its own.

As it is, you do not belong to the world, but I have chosen you out of the world.

That is why the world hates you.

Remember what I told you: 'A servant is not greater than his master.'

If they persecuted me, they will persecute you also.

If they obeyed my teaching, they will obey yours also.

They will treat you this way because of my name, for they do not know the one who sent me.

If I had not come and spoken to them, they would not be guilty of sin; but now they have no excuse for their sin.

Whoever hates me hates my Father as well.

If I had not done among them the works no one else did, they would not be guilty of sin.

But now they have seen these works, and yet they have hated both me and my Father.

But this is to fulfill what is written in their Law: 'They hated me without reason.'

When the Advocate comes, whom I will send to you from the Father--the Spirit of truth who goes out from the Father--he will testify about me.

And you also must testify, for you have been with me from the beginning.

## John 16

I have told you these things so you won't be upset.

They will kick you out of the community, and a time will come when anyone who kills you will think they are serving God.

They will do these things because they don't know the Father or me.

But I have told you this so that when the time comes, you will remember that I warned you.

I didn't tell you this from the beginning because I was with you.

Now I am going to the one who sent me, and none of you asks me, 'Where are you going?'

But because I have said these things, you are filled with sadness.

However, I am telling you the truth: it is better for you that I go away.

If I don't go, the Helper won't come to you.

But if I go, I will send him to you.

When he comes, he will show the world what is wrong about sin, righteousness, and judgment.

About sin, because they don't believe in me; about righteousness, because I am going to the Father and you won't see me anymore; and about judgment, because the ruler of this world has been judged.

I have much more to say to you, but you can't handle it now.

But when the Spirit of truth comes, he will guide you into all truth.

He won't speak on his own; he will speak only what he hears, and he will tell you what is to come.

He will glorify me because he will take from what is mine and make it known to you.

Everything that belongs to the Father is mine.

That is why I said the Spirit will take from what is mine and make it known to you.

In a little while, you won't see me anymore, and then after a little while, you will see me again.

Some of his disciples said to each other, 'What does he mean by saying, "In a little while you won't see me, and then after a little while you will see me," and "because I am going to the Father"?'

They kept asking, 'What does he mean by "a little while"? We don't understand what he is saying.'

Jesus knew they wanted to ask him about this, so he said to them, 'Are you asking one another what I meant when I said, "In a little while you won't see me, and then after a little while you will see me"?

Truly, truly, I tell you, you will weep and mourn while the world rejoices.

You will grieve, but your grief will turn to joy.

A woman giving birth to a child has pain because her time has come, but when her baby is born, she forgets the anguish because of her joy that a child is born into the world.

So with you: Now is your time of grief, but I will see you again and you will rejoice, and no one will take away your joy.

In that day you will no longer ask me anything.

Truly, truly, I tell you, my Father will give you whatever you ask in my name.

Until now you have not asked for anything in my name.

Ask and you will receive, and your joy will be complete.

Though I have been speaking figuratively, a time is coming when I will no longer use this kind of language but will tell you plainly about my Father.

In that day you will ask in my name.

I am not saying that I will ask the Father on your behalf.

No, the Father himself loves you because you have loved me and have believed that I came from God.

I came from the Father and entered the world; now I am leaving the world and going back to the Father.'

Then Jesus' disciples said, 'Now you are speaking clearly and without figures of speech.

Now we can see that you know all things and that you do not even need to have anyone ask you questions.

This makes us believe that you came from God.'

'Do you now believe?' Jesus replied.

'A time is coming and in fact has come when you will be scattered, each to your own home.

You will leave me all alone.

Yet I am not alone, for my Father is with me.

I have told you these things so that in me you may have peace.

In this world you will have trouble.

But take heart! I have overcome the world.'

## John 17

Jesus spoke these words, looked up to heaven, and said, "Father, the time has come.

Glorify your Son so that the Son may glorify you.

You have given him authority over all people so that he may give eternal life to all those you have given him.

And this is eternal life: that they know you, the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom you have sent.

I have glorified you on earth by completing the work you gave me to do.

Now, Father, glorify me in your presence with the glory I had with you before the world began.

I have revealed your name to the people you gave me from the world.

They were yours; you gave them to me, and they have kept your word.

Now they know that everything you have given me comes from you.

For I gave them the words you gave me, and they accepted them.

They knew with certainty that I came from you, and they believed that you sent me.

I pray for them.

I am not praying for the world, but for those you have given me, for they are yours.

All I have is yours, and all you have is mine.

And I have been glorified in them.

I will remain in the world no longer, but they are still in the world, and I am coming to you.

Holy Father, protect them by the power of your name, the name you gave me, so that they may be one as we are one.

While I was with them, I protected them and kept them safe by that name you gave me.

None has been lost except the one doomed to destruction so that Scripture would be fulfilled.

I am coming to you now, but I say these things while I am still in the world so that they may have the full measure of my joy within them.

I have given them your word, and the world has hated them, for they are not of the world any more than I am of the world.

My prayer is not that you take them out of the world but that you protect them from the evil one.

They are not of the world, even as I am not of it.

Sanctify them by the truth; your word is truth.

As you sent me into the world, I have sent them into the world.

For them, I sanctify myself, that they too may be truly sanctified.

My prayer is not for them alone.

I pray also for those who will believe in me through their message, that all of them may be one, Father, just as you are in me and I am in you.

May they also be in us so that the world may believe that you have sent me.

I have given them the glory that you gave me, that they may be one as we are one: I in them and you in me, so that they may be brought to complete unity.

Then the world will know that you sent me and have loved them even as you have loved me.

Father, I want those you have given me to be with me where I am and to see my glory, the glory you have given me because you loved me before the creation of the world.

Righteous Father, though the world does not know you, I know you, and they know that you have sent me.

I have made you known to them and will continue to make you known so that the love you have for me may be in them and that I myself may be in them.

## John 18

After Jesus said these things, he went out with his disciples across the Kidron Valley to a garden.

Judas, who was going to betray him, knew the place because Jesus often met there with his disciples.

Judas came with soldiers and officials from the chief priests and Pharisees, carrying torches, lanterns, and weapons.

Jesus, knowing what was going to happen, stepped forward and asked them, "Who are you looking for?"

They answered, "Jesus of Nazareth."

Jesus said, "I am he."

Judas, the one who betrayed him, was standing with them.

When Jesus said, "I am he," they drew back and fell to the ground.

Again, Jesus asked them, "Who are you looking for?"

They said, "Jesus of Nazareth."

Jesus replied, "I told you that I am he. If you are looking for me, let these men go."

This happened so that the words he had spoken would be fulfilled: "I have not lost one of those you gave me."

Then Simon Peter, who had a sword, drew it and struck the high priest's servant, cutting off his right ear.

The servant's name was Malchus.

Jesus said to Peter, "Put your sword away! Shall I not drink the cup the Father has given me?"

Then the soldiers, their commander, and the Jewish officials arrested Jesus and bound him.

They brought him first to Annas, who was the father-in-law of Caiaphas, the high priest that year.

Caiaphas was the one who had advised the Jewish leaders that it would be good if one man died for the people.

Simon Peter and another disciple were following Jesus.

Because this disciple was known to the high priest, he went with Jesus into the high priest's courtyard, but Peter had to wait outside at the door.

The other disciple, who was known to the high priest, came back, spoke to the servant girl on duty there, and brought Peter in.

"You aren't one of this man's disciples too, are you?" she asked Peter.

He replied, "I am not."

It was cold, and the servants and officials stood around a fire they had made to keep warm.

Peter also was standing with them, warming himself.

Meanwhile, the high priest questioned Jesus about his disciples and his teaching.

"I have spoken openly to the world," Jesus replied.

"I always taught in synagogues or at the temple, where all the Jews come together.

I said nothing in secret.

Why question me?

Ask those who heard me.

Surely they know what I said."

When Jesus said this, one of the officials nearby slapped him in the face.

"Is this the way you answer the high priest?" he demanded.

"If I said something wrong," Jesus replied, "testify as to what is wrong.

But if I spoke the truth, why did you strike me?"

Then Annas sent him bound to Caiaphas the high priest.

Meanwhile, Simon Peter was still standing there warming himself.

So they asked him, "You aren't one of his disciples too, are you?"

He denied it, saying, "I am not."

One of the high priest's servants, a relative of the man whose ear Peter had cut off, challenged him, "Didn't I see you with him in the garden?"

Again Peter denied it, and at that moment a rooster began to crow.

Then the Jewish leaders took Jesus from Caiaphas to the palace of the Roman governor.

By now it was early morning, and to avoid ceremonial uncleanness they did not enter the palace, because they wanted to be able to eat the Passover.

So Pilate came out to them and asked, "What charges are you bringing against this man?"

"If he were not a criminal," they replied, "we would not have handed him over to you."

Pilate said, "Take him yourselves and judge him by your own law."

"But we have no right to execute anyone," they objected.

This took place to fulfill what Jesus had said about the kind of death he was going to die.

Pilate then went back inside the palace, summoned Jesus, and asked him, "Are you the king of the Jews?"

"Is that your own idea," Jesus asked, "or did others talk to you about me?"

"Am I a Jew?" Pilate replied.

"Your own people and chief priests handed you over to me.

What is it you have done?"

Jesus said, "My kingdom is not of this world.

If it were, my servants would fight to prevent my arrest by the Jewish leaders.

But now my kingdom is from another place."

"You are a king, then!" said Pilate.

Jesus answered, "You say that I am a king.

In fact, the reason I was born and came into the world is to testify to the truth.

Everyone on the side of truth listens to me."

"What is truth?" retorted Pilate.

With this, he went out again to the Jews gathered there and said, "I find no basis for a charge against him.

But it is your custom for me to release to you one prisoner at the time of the Passover.

Do you want me to release 'the king of the Jews'?"

They shouted back, "No, not him!

Give us Barabbas!"

Now Barabbas had taken part in an uprising.

## John 19

Then Pilate took Jesus and had him whipped.

The soldiers made a crown of thorns and put it on his head, and they dressed him in a purple robe.

They came up to him and said, "Hail, King of the Jews!" and slapped him in the face.

Pilate went out again and said to them, "Look, I am bringing him out to you to let you know that I find no basis for a charge against him."

When Jesus came out wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe, Pilate said to them, "Here is the man!"

When the chief priests and their officials saw him, they shouted, "Crucify! Crucify!"

But Pilate answered, "You take him and crucify him. As for me, I find no basis for a charge against him."

The Jewish leaders insisted, "We have a law, and according to that law he must die, because he claimed to be the Son of God."

When Pilate heard this, he was even more afraid, and he went back inside the palace.

"Where do you come from?" he asked Jesus, but Jesus gave him no answer.

"Do you refuse to speak to me?" Pilate said.

"Don't you realize I have power either to free you or to crucify you?"

Jesus answered, "You would have no power over me if it were not given to you from above.

Therefore the one who handed me over to you is guilty of a greater sin."

From then on, Pilate tried to set Jesus free, but the Jewish leaders kept shouting, "If you let this man go, you are no friend of Caesar.

Anyone who claims to be a king opposes Caesar."

When Pilate heard this, he brought Jesus out and sat down on the judge's seat at a place known as the Stone Pavement (which in Aramaic is Gabbatha).

It was the day of Preparation of the Passover; it was about noon.

"Here is your king," Pilate said to the Jews.

But they shouted, "Take him away! Take him away! Crucify him!"

"Shall I crucify your king?" Pilate asked.

"We have no king but Caesar," the chief priests answered.

Finally, Pilate handed him over to them to be crucified.

So the soldiers took charge of Jesus.

Carrying his own cross, he went out to the place of the Skull (which in Aramaic is called Golgotha).

There they crucified him, and with him two others--one on each side and Jesus in the middle.

Pilate had a notice prepared and fastened to the cross.

It read: JESUS OF NAZARETH, THE KING OF THE JEWS.

Many of the Jews read this sign, for the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city, and the sign was written in Aramaic, Latin, and Greek.

The chief priests of the Jews protested to Pilate, "Do not write 'The King of the Jews,' but that this man claimed to be king of the Jews."

Pilate answered, "What I have written, I have written."

When the soldiers crucified Jesus, they took his clothes, dividing them into four shares, one for each of them, with the undergarment remaining.

This garment was seamless, woven in one piece from top to bottom.

"Let's not tear it," they said to one another.

"Let's decide by lot who will get it."

This happened that the scripture might be fulfilled that said, "They divided my clothes among them and cast lots for my garment."

So this is what the soldiers did.

Near the cross of Jesus stood his mother, his mother's sister, Mary the wife of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene.

When Jesus saw his mother there, and the disciple whom he loved standing nearby, he said to her, "Woman, here is your son," and to the disciple, "Here is your mother."

From that time on, this disciple took her into his home.

Later, knowing that everything had now been finished, and so that Scripture would be fulfilled, Jesus said, "I am thirsty."

A jar of wine vinegar was there, so they soaked a sponge in it, put the sponge on a stalk of the hyssop plant, and lifted it to Jesus' lips.

When he had received the drink, Jesus said, "It is finished."

With that, he bowed his head and gave up his spirit.

Now it was the day of Preparation, and the next day was to be a special Sabbath.

Because the Jewish leaders did not want the bodies left on the crosses during the Sabbath, they asked Pilate to have the legs broken and the bodies taken down.

The soldiers therefore came and broke the legs of the first man who had been crucified with Jesus, and then those of the other.

But when they came to Jesus and found that he was already dead, they did not break his legs.

Instead, one of the soldiers pierced Jesus' side with a spear, bringing a sudden flow of blood and water.

The man who saw it has given testimony, and his testimony is true.

He knows that he tells the truth, and he testifies so that you also may believe.

These things happened so that the scripture would be fulfilled: "Not one of his bones will be broken," and, as another scripture says, "They will look on the one they have pierced."

Later, Joseph of Arimathea asked Pilate for the body of Jesus.

Now Joseph was a disciple of Jesus, but secretly because he feared the Jewish leaders.

With Pilate's permission, he came and took the body away.

He was accompanied by Nicodemus, the man who earlier had visited Jesus at night.

Nicodemus brought a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about seventy-five pounds.

Taking Jesus' body, the two of them wrapped it, with the spices, in strips of linen.

This was in accordance with Jewish burial customs.

At the place where Jesus was crucified, there was a garden, and in the garden a new tomb, in which no one had ever been laid.

Because it was the Jewish day of Preparation and since the tomb was nearby, they laid Jesus there.

## John 20

On the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene went to the tomb early in the morning while it was still dark.

She saw that the stone had been removed from the entrance.

So she ran to Simon Peter and the other disciple, the one Jesus loved, and said, "They have taken the Lord out of the tomb, and we don't know where they have put him!"

So Peter and the other disciple started for the tomb.

Both were running, but the other disciple outran Peter and reached the tomb first.

He bent over and looked in at the strips of linen lying there but did not go in.

Then Simon Peter came along behind him and went straight into the tomb.

He saw the strips of linen lying there, as well as the cloth that had been wrapped around Jesus' head.

The cloth was still lying in its place, separate from the linen.

Finally, the other disciple, who had reached the tomb first, also went inside.

He saw and believed.

(They still did not understand from Scripture that Jesus had to rise from the dead.)

Then the disciples went back to where they were staying.

Now Mary stood outside the tomb crying.

As she wept, she bent over to look into the tomb and saw two angels in white, seated where Jesus' body had been, one at the head and the other at the foot.

They asked her, "Woman, why are you crying?"

"They have taken my Lord away," she said, "and I don't know where they have put him."

At this, she turned around and saw Jesus standing there, but she did not realize that it was Jesus.

He asked her, "Woman, why are you crying? Who is it you are looking for?"

Thinking he was the gardener, she said, "Sir, if you have carried him away, tell me where you have put him, and I will get him."

Jesus said to her, "Mary."

She turned toward him and cried out in Aramaic, "Rabboni!" (which means "Teacher").

Jesus said, "Do not hold on to me, for I have not yet ascended to the Father.

Go instead to my brothers and tell them, 'I am ascending to my Father and your Father, to my God and your God.'"

Mary Magdalene went to the disciples with the news: "I have seen the Lord!"

And she told them that he had said these things to her.

On the evening of that first day of the week, when the disciples were together, with the doors locked for fear of the Jewish leaders, Jesus came and stood among them and said, "Peace be with you!"

After he said this, he showed them his hands and side.

The disciples were overjoyed when they saw the Lord.

Again Jesus said, "Peace be with you! As the Father has sent me, I am sending you."

And with that he breathed on them and said, "Receive the Holy Spirit.

If you forgive anyone's sins, their sins are forgiven; if you do not forgive them, they are not forgiven."

Now Thomas (also known as Didymus), one of the Twelve, was not with the disciples when Jesus came.

So the other disciples told him, "We have seen the Lord!"

But he said to them, "Unless I see the nail marks in his hands and put my finger where the nails were, and put my hand into his side, I will not believe."

A week later his disciples were in the house again, and Thomas was with them.

Though the doors were locked, Jesus came and stood among them and said, "Peace be with you!"

Then he said to Thomas, "Put your finger here; see my hands.

Reach out your hand and put it into my side.

Stop doubting and believe."

Thomas said to him, "My Lord and my God!"

Then Jesus told him, "Because you have seen me, you have believed; blessed are those who have not seen and yet have believed."

Jesus performed many other signs in the presence of his disciples, which are not recorded in this book.

But these are written that you may believe that Jesus is the Messiah, the Son of God, and that by believing you may have life in his name.

## John 21

After this, Jesus showed himself again to his disciples by the Sea of Tiberias.

This is how it happened: Simon Peter, Thomas (also called the Twin), Nathanael from Cana in Galilee, the sons of Zebedee, and two other disciples were together.

Simon Peter said to them, "I'm going fishing."

They said, "We'll go with you."

So they went out and got into the boat, but that night they caught nothing.

Early in the morning, Jesus stood on the shore, but the disciples did not realize it was him.

He called out to them, "Friends, haven't you any fish?"

"No," they answered.

He said, "Throw your net on the right side of the boat and you will find some."

When they did, they were unable to haul the net in because of the large number of fish.

Then the disciple whom Jesus loved said to Peter, "It is the Lord!"

As soon as Simon Peter heard him say, "It is the Lord," he wrapped his outer garment around him (for he had taken it off) and jumped into the water.

The other disciples followed in the boat, towing the net full of fish, for they were not far from shore, about a hundred yards.

When they landed, they saw a fire of burning coals there with fish on it, and some bread.

Jesus said to them, "Bring some of the fish you have just caught."

So Simon Peter climbed back into the boat and dragged the net ashore.

It was full of large fish, 153, but even with so many the net was not torn.

Jesus said to them, "Come and have breakfast."

None of the disciples dared ask him, "Who are you?"

They knew it was the Lord.

Jesus came, took the bread and gave it to them, and did the same with the fish.

This was now the third time Jesus appeared to his disciples after he was raised from the dead.

When they had finished eating, Jesus said to Simon Peter, "Simon son of John, do you love me more than these?"

"Yes, Lord," he said, "you know that I love you."

Jesus said, "Feed my lambs."

Again Jesus said, "Simon son of John, do you love me?"

He answered, "Yes, Lord, you know that I love you."

Jesus said, "Take care of my sheep."

The third time he said to him, "Simon son of John, do you love me?"

Peter was hurt because Jesus asked him the third time, "Do you love me?"

He said, "Lord, you know all things; you know that I love you."

Jesus said, "Feed my sheep.

Very truly I tell you, when you were younger you dressed yourself and went where you wanted; but when you are old you will stretch out your hands, and someone else will dress you and lead you where you do not want to go."

Jesus said this to indicate the kind of death by which Peter would glorify God.

Then he said to him, "Follow me!"

Peter turned and saw the disciple whom Jesus loved was following them.

This was the one who had leaned back against Jesus at the supper and had said, "Lord, who is going to betray you?"

When Peter saw him, he asked, "Lord, what about him?"

Jesus answered, "If I want him to remain alive until I return, what is that to you? You must follow me."

Because of this, the rumor spread among the believers that this disciple would not die.

But Jesus did not say that he would not die; he only said, "If I want him to remain alive until I return, what is that to you?"

This is the disciple who testifies to these things and who wrote them down.

We know that his testimony is true.

Jesus did many other things as well.

If every one of them were written down, I suppose that even the whole world would not have room for the books that would be written.

## Luke 1

Since many people have tried to write down the story of the things that have happened among us, just as those who were eyewitnesses and servants of the word from the beginning have passed them on to us, I too decided, after carefully investigating everything from the start, to write an orderly account for you, most excellent Theophilus, so that you may know the certainty of the things you have been taught.

In the days of Herod, king of Judea, there was a priest named Zechariah, from the division of Abijah, and his wife was from the daughters of Aaron, and her name was Elizabeth.

They were both righteous before God, living blamelessly according to all the commandments and regulations of the Lord.

But they had no child because Elizabeth was barren, and both were advanced in years.

While Zechariah was serving as a priest before God in the order of his division, it was his turn to enter the temple of the Lord and burn incense.

And the whole assembly of people was praying outside at the hour of incense.

Then an angel of the Lord appeared to him, standing at the right side of the altar of incense.

Zechariah was troubled when he saw him, and fear fell upon him.

But the angel said to him, "Do not be afraid, Zechariah, for your prayer has been heard, and your wife Elizabeth will bear you a son, and you shall call his name John.

You will have joy and gladness, and many will rejoice at his birth, for he will be great before the Lord.

He must not drink wine or strong drink, and he will be filled with the Holy Spirit even from his mother's womb.

He will turn many of the children of Israel to the Lord their God, and he will go before him in the spirit and power of Elijah, to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just, to make ready for the Lord a people prepared."

Zechariah said to the angel, "How shall I know this? For I am an old man, and my wife is advanced in years."

The angel answered him, "I am Gabriel.

I stand in the presence of God, and I was sent to speak to you and to bring you this good news.

And behold, you will be silent and unable to speak until the day that these things take place, because you did not believe my words, which will be fulfilled in their time."

The people were waiting for Zechariah, and they were wondering at his delay in the temple.

When he came out, he was unable to speak to them, and they realized that he had seen a vision in the temple.

He kept making signs to them and remained mute.

When his time of service was completed, he returned home.

After this, his wife Elizabeth became pregnant and for five months remained in seclusion.

"The Lord has done this for me," she said.

"In these days he has shown his favor and taken away my disgrace among the people."

In the sixth month, God sent the angel Gabriel to Nazareth, a town in Galilee, to a virgin pledged to be married to a man named Joseph, a descendant of David.

The virgin's name was Mary.

The angel went to her and said, "Greetings, you who are highly favored!

The Lord is with you."

Mary was greatly troubled at his words and wondered what kind of greeting this might be.

But the angel said to her, "Do not be afraid, Mary, you have found favor with God.

You will conceive and give birth to a son, and you are to call him Jesus.

He will be great and will be called the Son of the Most High.

The Lord God will give him the throne of his father David, and he will reign over Jacob's descendants forever; his kingdom will never end."

"How will this be," Mary asked the angel, "since I am a virgin?"

The angel answered, "The Holy Spirit will come on you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you.

So the holy one to be born will be called the Son of God.

Even Elizabeth your relative is going to have a child in her old age, and she who was said to be unable to conceive is in her sixth month.

For no word from God will ever fail."

"I am the Lord's servant," Mary answered.

"May your word to me be fulfilled."

Then the angel left her.

At that time Mary got ready and hurried to a town in the hill country of Judea, where she entered Zechariah's home and greeted Elizabeth.

When Elizabeth heard Mary's greeting, the baby leaped in her womb, and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit.

In a loud voice she exclaimed: "Blessed are you among women, and blessed is the child you will bear!

But why am I so favored, that the mother of my Lord should come to me?

As soon as the sound of your greeting reached my ears, the baby in my womb leaped for joy.

Blessed is she who has believed that the Lord would fulfill his promises to her!"

And Mary said: "My soul glorifies the Lord and my spirit rejoices in God my Savior, for he has been mindful of the humble state of his servant.

From now on all generations will call me blessed, for the Mighty One has done great things for me--holy is his name.

His mercy extends to those who fear him, from generation to generation.

He has performed mighty deeds with his arm; he has scattered those who are proud in their inmost thoughts.

He has brought down rulers from their thrones but has lifted up the humble.

He has filled the hungry with good things but has sent the rich away empty.

He has helped his servant Israel, remembering to be merciful to Abraham and his descendants forever, just as he promised our ancestors."

Mary stayed with Elizabeth for about three months and then returned home.

When it was time for Elizabeth to have her baby, she gave birth to a son.

Her neighbors and relatives heard that the Lord had shown her great mercy, and they shared her joy.

On the eighth day, they came to circumcise the child, and they were going to name him after his father Zechariah, but his mother spoke up and said, "No!

He is to be called John."

They said to her, "There is no one among your relatives who has that name."

Then they made signs to his father, to find out what he would like to name the child.

He asked for a writing tablet, and to everyone's astonishment, he wrote, "His name is John."

Immediately his mouth was opened and his tongue set free, and he began to speak, praising God.

All the neighbors were filled with awe, and throughout the hill country of Judea, people were talking about all these things.

Everyone who heard this wondered about it, asking, "What then is this child going to be?"

For the Lord's hand was with him.

His father Zechariah was filled with the Holy Spirit and prophesied: "Praise be to the Lord, the God of Israel, because he has come to his people and redeemed them.

He has raised up a horn of salvation for us in the house of his servant David (as he said through his holy prophets of long ago), salvation from our enemies and from the hand of all who hate us--to show mercy to our ancestors and to remember his holy covenant, the oath he swore to our father Abraham: to rescue us from the hand of our enemies, and to enable us to serve him without fear in holiness and righteousness before him all our days.

And you, my child, will be called a prophet of the Most High; for you will go on before the Lord to prepare the way for him, to give his people the knowledge of salvation through the forgiveness of their sins, because of the tender mercy of our God, by which the rising sun will come to us from heaven to shine on those living in darkness and in the shadow of death, to guide our feet into the path of peace."

And the child grew and became strong in spirit, and he lived in the wilderness until he appeared publicly to Israel.

## Luke 2

In those days, Caesar Augustus made a decree that everyone in the Roman Empire should be registered.

This was the first registration when Quirinius was governor of Syria.

Everyone went to their own town to register.

Joseph also went from the town of Nazareth in Galilee to Judea, to the city of David called Bethlehem, because he was from the house and family of David.

He went to be registered with Mary, who was engaged to him and was expecting a child.

While they were there, the time came for her to give birth, and she had her firstborn son.

She wrapped him in cloths and laid him in a manger because there was no room for them in the inn.

Shepherds were in the fields nearby, keeping watch over their flocks at night.

An angel of the Lord appeared to them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them, and they were terrified.

But the angel said to them, "Do not be afraid. I bring you good news of great joy for all people.

Today in the city of David, a Savior has been born to you; he is Christ the Lord.

This will be a sign to you: You will find a baby wrapped in cloths and lying in a manger."

Suddenly, a great company of the heavenly host appeared with the angel, praising God and saying, "Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace to those on whom his favor rests."

When the angels had left them and gone into heaven, the shepherds said to one another, "Let's go to Bethlehem and see this thing that has happened, which the Lord has told us about."

So they hurried off and found Mary and Joseph, and the baby, who was lying in the manger.

When they had seen him, they spread the word about what had been told them about this child, and all who heard it were amazed at what the shepherds said to them.

But Mary treasured up all these things and pondered them in her heart.

The shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all the things they had heard and seen, which were just as they had been told.

On the eighth day, when it was time to circumcise the child, he was named Jesus, the name the angel had given him before he was conceived.

When the time came for their purification according to the Law of Moses, they took him to Jerusalem to present him to the Lord, as it is written in the Law of the Lord, "Every firstborn male is to be consecrated to the Lord," and to offer a sacrifice in keeping with what is said in the Law of the Lord: "a pair of doves or two young pigeons."

Now there was a man in Jerusalem called Simeon, who was righteous and devout.

He was waiting for the consolation of Israel, and the Holy Spirit was on him.

It had been revealed to him by the Holy Spirit that he would not die before he had seen the Lord's Messiah.

Moved by the Spirit, he went into the temple courts.

When the parents brought in the child Jesus to do for him what the custom of the Law required, Simeon took him in his arms and praised God, saying, "Sovereign Lord, as you have promised, you may now dismiss your servant in peace.

For my eyes have seen your salvation, which you have prepared in the sight of all nations: a light for revelation to the Gentiles, and the glory of your people Israel."

The child's father and mother marveled at what was said about him.

Then Simeon blessed them and said to Mary, his mother, "This child is destined to cause the falling and rising of many in Israel, and to be a sign that will be spoken against, so that the thoughts of many hearts will be revealed.

And a sword will pierce your own soul too."

There was also a prophet, Anna, the daughter of Penuel, of the tribe of Asher.

She was very old; she had lived with her husband seven years after her marriage, and then was a widow until she was eighty-four.

She never left the temple but worshiped night and day, fasting and praying.

Coming up to them at that very moment, she gave thanks to God and spoke about the child to all who were looking forward to the redemption of Jerusalem.

When Joseph and Mary had done everything required by the Law of the Lord, they returned to Galilee, to their own town of Nazareth.

And the child grew and became strong; he was filled with wisdom, and the grace of God was on him.

Every year Jesus' parents went to Jerusalem for the Festival of the Passover.

When he was twelve years old, they went up to the festival, according to the custom.

After the festival was over, while his parents were returning home, the boy Jesus stayed behind in Jerusalem, but they were unaware of it.

Thinking he was in their company, they traveled on for a day.

Then they began looking for him among their relatives and friends.

When they did not find him, they went back to Jerusalem to look for him.

After three days, they found him in the temple courts, sitting among the teachers, listening to them and asking them questions.

Everyone who heard him was amazed at his understanding and his answers.

When his parents saw him, they were astonished.

His mother said to him, "Son, why have you treated us like this? Your father and I have been anxiously searching for you."

"Why were you searching for me?" he asked.

"Didn't you know I had to be in my Father's house?"

But they did not understand what he was saying to them.

Then he went down to Nazareth with them and was obedient to them.

But his mother treasured all these things in her heart.

And Jesus grew in wisdom and stature, and in favor with God and man.

## Luke 3

In the fifteenth year of the rule of Tiberius Caesar, when Pontius Pilate was governor of Judea, and Herod was ruler of Galilee, and his brother Philip was ruler of Iturea and Trachonitis, and Lysanias was ruler of Abilene, during the high priesthood of Annas and Caiaphas, the word of God came to John, the son of Zechariah, in the wilderness.

He went into all the region around the Jordan, preaching a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins, as it is written in the book of the words of Isaiah the prophet: "A voice of one calling in the wilderness, 'Prepare the way for the Lord, make straight paths for him.

Every valley shall be filled in, every mountain and hill made low.

The crooked roads shall become straight, the rough ways smooth.

And all people will see God's salvation.'"

John said to the crowds coming out to be baptized by him, "You brood of vipers!

Who warned you to flee from the coming wrath?

Produce fruit in keeping with repentance.

And do not begin to say to yourselves, 'We have Abraham as our father.'

For I tell you that out of these stones God can raise up children for Abraham.

The ax is already at the root of the trees, and every tree that does not produce good fruit will be cut down and thrown into the fire."

The crowds asked him, "What should we do then?"

John answered, "Anyone who has two shirts should share with the one who has none, and anyone who has food should do the same."

Even tax collectors came to be baptized.

"Teacher," they asked, "what should we do?"

"Don't collect any more than you are required to," he told them.

Then some soldiers asked him, "And what should we do?"

He replied, "Don't extort money and don't accuse people falsely--be content with your pay."

The people were waiting expectantly and were all wondering in their hearts if John might possibly be the Messiah.

John answered them all, "I baptize you with water.

But one who is more powerful than I will come, the straps of whose sandals I am not worthy to untie.

He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire.

His winnowing fork is in his hand to clear his threshing floor and to gather the wheat into his barn, but he will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire."

And with many other words John exhorted the people and proclaimed the good news to them.

But when John rebuked Herod the tetrarch because of his marriage to Herodias, his brother's wife, and all the other evil things he had done, Herod added this to them all: He locked John up in prison.

When all the people were being baptized, Jesus was baptized too.

And as he was praying, heaven was opened and the Holy Spirit descended on him in bodily form like a dove.

And a voice came from heaven: "You are my Son, whom I love; with you I am well pleased."

Now Jesus himself was about thirty years old when he began his ministry.

He was the son, so it was thought, of Joseph, the son of Heli, the son of Matthat, the son of Levi, the son of Melchi, the son of Jannai, the son of Joseph, the son of Mattathias, the son of Amos, the son of Nahum, the son of Esli, the son of Naggai, the son of Maath, the son of Mattathias, the son of Semein, the son of Josech, the son of Joda, the son of Joanan, the son of Rhesa, the son of Zerubbabel, the son of Shealtiel, the son of Neri, the son of Melchi, the son of Addi, the son of Cosam, the son of Elmadam, the son of Er, the son of Joshua, the son of Eliezer, the son of Jorim, the son of Matthat, the son of Levi, the son of Simeon, the son of Judah, the son of Joseph, the son of Jonam, the son of Eliakim, the son of Melea, the son of Menna, the son of Mattatha, the son of Nathan, the son of David, the son of Jesse, the son of Obed, the son of Boaz, the son of Salmon, the son of Nahshon, the son of Amminadab, the son of Admin, the son of Arni, the son of Hezron, the son of Perez, the son of Judah, the son of Jacob, the son of Isaac, the son of Abraham, the son of Terah, the son of Nahor, the son of Serug, the son of Reu, the son of Peleg, the son of Eber, the son of Shelah, the son of Cainan, the son of Arphaxad, the son of Shem, the son of Noah, the son of Lamech, the son of Methuselah, the son of Enoch, the son of Jared, the son of Mahalalel, the son of Cainan, the son of Enosh, the son of Seth, the son of Adam, the son of God.

## Luke 4

Jesus, full of the Holy Spirit, returned from the Jordan River and was led by the Spirit into the desert for forty days, where he was tempted by the devil.

During that time, he didn't eat anything, and when it was over, he was hungry.

The devil said to him, "If you are the Son of God, tell this stone to become bread."

Jesus answered, "It is written: 'Man shall not live on bread alone.'"

Then the devil took him to a high place and showed him all the kingdoms of the world in an instant.

He said, "I will give you all their authority and glory, for it has been given to me, and I can give it to anyone I want.

If you worship me, it will all be yours."

Jesus replied, "It is written: 'Worship the Lord your God and serve him only.'"

The devil then took him to Jerusalem and had him stand on the highest point of the temple.

"If you are the Son of God," he said, "throw yourself down from here.

For it is written: 'He will command his angels concerning you to guard you carefully; they will lift you up in their hands, so that you will not strike your foot against a stone.'"

Jesus answered, "It is said: 'Do not put the Lord your God to the test.'"

When the devil had finished all this tempting, he left him until an opportune time.

Jesus returned to Galilee in the power of the Spirit, and news about him spread through the whole countryside.

He was teaching in their synagogues, and everyone praised him.

He went to Nazareth, where he had been brought up, and on the Sabbath day he went into the synagogue, as was his custom.

He stood up to read, and the scroll of the prophet Isaiah was handed to him.

Unrolling it, he found the place where it is written: "The Spirit of the Lord is on me, because he has anointed me to proclaim good news to the poor.

He has sent me to proclaim freedom for the prisoners and recovery of sight for the blind, to set the oppressed free, to proclaim the year of the Lord's favor."

Then he rolled up the scroll, gave it back to the attendant, and sat down.

The eyes of everyone in the synagogue were fastened on him.

He began by saying to them, "Today this scripture is fulfilled in your hearing."

All spoke well of him and were amazed at the gracious words that came from his lips.

"Isn't this Joseph's son?" they asked.

Jesus said to them, "Surely you will quote this proverb to me: 'Physician, heal yourself!'

And you will tell me, 'Do here in your hometown what we have heard that you did in Capernaum.'"

"Truly I tell you," he continued, "no prophet is accepted in his hometown.

I assure you that there were many widows in Israel in Elijah's time, when the sky was shut for three and a half years and there was a severe famine throughout the land.

Yet Elijah was not sent to any of them, but to a widow in Zarephath in the region of Sidon.

And there were many in Israel with leprosy in the time of Elisha the prophet, yet not one of them was cleansed--only Naaman the Syrian."

All the people in the synagogue were furious when they heard this.

They got up, drove him out of the town, and took him to the brow of the hill on which the town was built, in order to throw him off the cliff.

But he walked right through the crowd and went on his way.

Then he went down to Capernaum, a town in Galilee, and on the Sabbath he taught the people.

They were amazed at his teaching, because his words had authority.

In the synagogue, there was a man possessed by a demon, an impure spirit.

He cried out at the top of his voice, "Go away! What do you want with us, Jesus of Nazareth?

Have you come to destroy us?

I know who you are--the Holy One of God!"

"Be quiet!" Jesus said sternly.

"Come out of him!"

Then the demon threw the man down before them all and came out without injuring him.

All the people were amazed and said to each other, "What words these are!

With authority and power he gives orders to impure spirits and they come out!"

And the news about him spread throughout the surrounding area.

Jesus left the synagogue and went to the home of Simon.

Now Simon's mother-in-law was suffering from a high fever, and they asked Jesus to help her.

So he bent over her and rebuked the fever, and it left her.

She got up at once and began to wait on them.

At sunset, the people brought to Jesus all who had various kinds of sickness, and laying his hands on each one, he healed them.

Moreover, demons came out of many people, shouting, "You are the Son of God!"

But he rebuked them and would not allow them to speak, because they knew he was the Messiah.

At daybreak, Jesus went out to a solitary place.

The people were looking for him and when they came to where he was, they tried to keep him from leaving them.

But he said, "I must proclaim the good news of the kingdom of God to the other towns also, because that is why I was sent."

And he kept on preaching in the synagogues of Judea.

## Luke 5

One day, as Jesus was standing by the Lake of Gennesaret, a crowd gathered around him to hear the word of God.

He saw two boats by the lake, and the fishermen had left them to wash their nets.

Jesus got into one of the boats, which belonged to Simon, and asked him to push it out a little from the shore.

Then he sat down and taught the people from the boat.

When he finished speaking, he told Simon, "Go out into the deep water and let down your nets for a catch."

Simon replied, "Master, we've worked hard all night and haven't caught anything.

But because you say so, I will let down the nets."

When they did, they caught such a large number of fish that their nets began to break.

They signaled to their partners in the other boat to come and help them, and they came and filled both boats so full that they began to sink.

When Simon Peter saw this, he fell at Jesus' knees and said, "Go away from me, Lord; I am a sinful man!"

For he and all his companions were astonished at the catch of fish they had taken, and so were James and John, the sons of Zebedee, Simon's partners.

Then Jesus said to Simon, "Don't be afraid; from now on you will fish for people."

So they pulled their boats up on shore, left everything, and followed him.

While Jesus was in one of the towns, a man covered with leprosy saw him and fell with his face to the ground and begged him, "Lord, if you are willing, you can make me clean."

Jesus reached out his hand and touched the man.

"I am willing," he said.

"Be clean!"

And immediately the leprosy left him.

Then Jesus ordered him, "Don't tell anyone, but go, show yourself to the priest and offer the sacrifices that Moses commanded for your cleansing, as a testimony to them."

Yet the news about him spread all the more, so that crowds of people came to hear him and to be healed of their sicknesses.

But Jesus often withdrew to lonely places and prayed.

One day Jesus was teaching, and Pharisees and teachers of the law were sitting there.

They had come from every village of Galilee and from Judea and Jerusalem.

And the power of the Lord was with Jesus to heal the sick.

Some men came carrying a paralyzed man on a mat and tried to take him into the house to lay him before Jesus.

When they could not find a way to do this because of the crowd, they went up on the roof and lowered him on his mat through the tiles into the middle of the crowd, right in front of Jesus.

When Jesus saw their faith, he said, "Friend, your sins are forgiven."

The Pharisees and the teachers of the law began thinking to themselves, "Who is this fellow who speaks blasphemy?

Who can forgive sins but God alone?"

Jesus knew what they were thinking and asked, "Why are you thinking these things in your hearts?

Which is easier: to say, 'Your sins are forgiven,' or to say, 'Get up and walk'?

But I want you to know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins."

So he said to the paralyzed man, "I tell you, get up, take your mat and go home."

Immediately he stood up in front of them, took what he had been lying on, and went home praising God.

Everyone was amazed and gave praise to God.

They were filled with awe and said, "We have seen remarkable things today."

After this, Jesus went out and saw a tax collector by the name of Levi sitting at his tax booth.

"Follow me," Jesus said to him, and Levi got up, left everything and followed him.

Then Levi held a great banquet for Jesus at his house, and a large crowd of tax collectors and others were eating with them.

But the Pharisees and the teachers of the law who belonged to their sect complained to his disciples, "Why do you eat and drink with tax collectors and sinners?"

Jesus answered them, "It is not the healthy who need a doctor, but the sick.

I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance."

They said to him, "John's disciples often fast and pray, and so do the disciples of the Pharisees, but yours go on eating and drinking."

Jesus answered, "Can you make the friends of the bridegroom fast while he is with them?

But the time will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them; in those days they will fast."

He told them this parable: "No one tears a piece out of a new garment to patch an old one.

Otherwise, they will have torn the new garment, and the patch from the new will not match the old.

And no one pours new wine into old wineskins.

Otherwise, the new wine will burst the skins; the wine will run out and the wineskins will be ruined.

No, new wine must be poured into new wineskins.

And no one after drinking old wine wants the new, for they say, 'The old is better.'"

## Luke 6

One Sabbath, Jesus was walking through some grain fields, and his disciples were picking and eating the heads of grain, rubbing them in their hands.

Some Pharisees asked, "Why are you doing what is not lawful on the Sabbath?"

Jesus answered, "Haven't you read what David did when he and his companions were hungry?

He entered the house of God, took the consecrated bread, ate it, and gave some to his companions, even though it is only lawful for priests to eat."

Then he said to them, "The Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath."

On another Sabbath, Jesus went into the synagogue and was teaching, and a man was there whose right hand was shriveled.

The teachers of the law and the Pharisees were watching him closely to see if he would heal on the Sabbath, so they could accuse him.

But Jesus knew what they were thinking and said to the man with the shriveled hand, "Get up and stand in front of everyone."

So he got up and stood there.

Then Jesus said to them, "I ask you, which is lawful on the Sabbath: to do good or to do evil, to save life or to destroy it?"

He looked around at them all and then said to the man, "Stretch out your hand."

He did so, and his hand was completely restored.

But the Pharisees and the teachers of the law were furious and began to discuss with one another what they might do to Jesus.

One of those days, Jesus went out to a mountainside to pray, and spent the night praying to God.

When morning came, he called his disciples to him and chose twelve of them, whom he also designated apostles: Simon (whom he named Peter), his brother Andrew, James, John, Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew, Thomas, James son of Alphaeus, Simon who was called the Zealot, Judas son of James, and Judas Iscariot, who became a traitor.

He went down with them and stood on a level place.

A large crowd of his disciples was there and a great number of people from all over Judea, from Jerusalem, and from the coastal region around Tyre and Sidon, who had come to hear him and to be healed of their diseases.

Those troubled by impure spirits were cured, and the people all tried to touch him, because power was coming from him and healing them all.

Looking at his disciples, he said: "Blessed are you who are poor, for yours is the kingdom of God.

Blessed are you who hunger now, for you will be satisfied.

Blessed are you who weep now, for you will laugh.

Blessed are you when people hate you, when they exclude you and insult you and reject your name as evil, because of the Son of Man.

Rejoice in that day and leap for joy, because great is your reward in heaven.

For that is how their ancestors treated the prophets.

But woe to you who are rich, for you have already received your comfort.

Woe to you who are well fed now, for you will go hungry.

Woe to you who laugh now, for you will mourn and weep.

Woe to you when everyone speaks well of you, for that is how their ancestors treated the false prophets.

But to you who are listening I say: Love your enemies, do good to those who hate you, bless those who curse you, pray for those who mistreat you.

If someone slaps you on one cheek, turn to them the other also.

If someone takes your coat, do not withhold your shirt from them.

Give to everyone who asks you, and if anyone takes what belongs to you, do not demand it back.

Do to others as you would have them do to you.

If you love those who love you, what credit is that to you?

Even sinners love those who love them.

And if you do good to those who are good to you, what credit is that to you?

Even sinners do that.

And if you lend to those from whom you expect repayment, what credit is that to you?

Even sinners lend to sinners, expecting to be repaid in full.

But love your enemies, do good to them, and lend to them without expecting to get anything back.

Then your reward will be great, and you will be children of the Most High, because he is kind to the ungrateful and wicked.

Be merciful, just as your Father is merciful.

Do not judge, and you will not be judged.

Do not condemn, and you will not be condemned.

Forgive, and you will be forgiven.

Give, and it will be given to you.

A good measure, pressed down, shaken together and running over, will be poured into your lap.

For with the measure you use, it will be measured to you."

He also told them this parable: "Can the blind lead the blind?

Will they not both fall into a pit?

The student is not above the teacher, but everyone who is fully trained will be like their teacher.

Why do you look at the speck of sawdust in your brother's eye and pay no attention to the plank in your own eye?

How can you say to your brother, 'Brother, let me take the speck out of your eye,' when you yourself fail to see the plank in your own eye?

You hypocrite, first take the plank out of your eye, and then you will see clearly to remove the speck from your brother's eye.

No good tree bears bad fruit, nor does a bad tree bear good fruit.

Each tree is recognized by its own fruit.

People do not pick figs from thornbushes, or grapes from briers.

A good man brings good things out of the good stored up in his heart, and an evil man brings evil things out of the evil stored up in his heart.

For the mouth speaks what the heart is full of.

Why do you call me, 'Lord, Lord,' and do not do what I say?

As for everyone who comes to me and hears my words and puts them into practice, I will show you what they are like.

They are like a man building a house, who dug down deep and laid the foundation on rock.

When a flood came, the torrent struck that house but could not shake it, because it was well built.

But the one who hears my words and does not put them into practice is like a man who built a house on the ground without a foundation.

The moment the torrent struck that house, it collapsed and its destruction was complete.

## Luke 7

After Jesus finished speaking to the people, he went to Capernaum.

There, a Roman officer had a servant who was very sick and about to die.

The officer valued this servant highly.

When he heard about Jesus, he sent some Jewish elders to ask Jesus to come and heal his servant.

The elders went to Jesus and pleaded with him, saying, "This man deserves your help because he loves our nation and has built our synagogue."

So Jesus went with them.

When he was not far from the house, the officer sent friends to say to him, "Lord, don't trouble yourself, for I am not worthy to have you come under my roof.

That is why I did not even consider myself worthy to come to you.

But just say the word, and my servant will be healed.

For I myself am a man under authority, with soldiers under me.

I tell this one, 'Go,' and he goes; and that one, 'Come,' and he comes.

I say to my servant, 'Do this,' and he does it."

When Jesus heard this, he was amazed at him, and turning to the crowd following him, he said, "I tell you, I have not found such great faith even in Israel."

Then the men who had been sent returned to the house and found the servant well.

Soon after, Jesus went to a town called Nain, and his disciples and a large crowd went along with him.

As he approached the town gate, a dead person was being carried out--the only son of his mother, and she was a widow.

A large crowd from the town was with her.

When the Lord saw her, his heart went out to her and he said, "Don't cry."

Then he went up and touched the bier they were carrying him on, and the bearers stood still.

He said, "Young man, I say to you, get up!"

The dead man sat up and began to talk, and Jesus gave him back to his mother.

They were all filled with awe and praised God.

"A great prophet has appeared among us," they said.

"God has come to help his people."

This news about Jesus spread throughout Judea and the surrounding country.

John's disciples told him about all these things.

Calling two of them, he sent them to the Lord to ask, "Are you the one who is to come, or should we expect someone else?"

When the men came to Jesus, they said, "John the Baptist sent us to you to ask, 'Are you the one who is to come, or should we expect someone else?'"

At that very time, Jesus cured many who had diseases, sicknesses, and evil spirits, and gave sight to many who were blind.

So he replied to the messengers, "Go back and report to John what you have seen and heard: The blind receive sight, the lame walk, those who have leprosy are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, and the good news is proclaimed to the poor.

Blessed is anyone who does not stumble on account of me."

After John's messengers left, Jesus began to speak to the crowd about John: "What did you go out into the wilderness to see?

A reed swayed by the wind?

If not, what did you go out to see?

A man dressed in fine clothes?

No, those who wear expensive clothes and indulge in luxury are in palaces.

But what did you go out to see?

A prophet?

Yes, I tell you, and more than a prophet.

This is the one about whom it is written: 'I will send my messenger ahead of you, who will prepare your way before you.'

I tell you, among those born of women there is no one greater than John; yet the one who is least in the kingdom of God is greater than he."

All the people, even the tax collectors, when they heard Jesus' words, acknowledged that God's way was right, because they had been baptized by John.

But the Pharisees and the experts in the law rejected God's purpose for themselves, because they had not been baptized by John.

Jesus went on to say, "To what, then, can I compare the people of this generation?

What are they like?

They are like children sitting in the marketplace and calling out to each other: 'We played the pipe for you, and you did not dance; we sang a dirge, and you did not cry.'

For John the Baptist came neither eating bread nor drinking wine, and you say, 'He has a demon.'

The Son of Man came eating and drinking, and you say, 'Here is a glutton and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners.'

But wisdom is proved right by all her children."

One of the Pharisees invited Jesus to have dinner with him, so he went to the Pharisee's house and reclined at the table.

A woman in that town who lived a sinful life learned that Jesus was eating at the Pharisee's house, so she came there with an alabaster jar of perfume.

As she stood behind him at his feet weeping, she began to wet his feet with her tears.

Then she wiped them with her hair, kissed them, and poured perfume on them.

When the Pharisee who had invited him saw this, he said to himself, "If this man were a prophet, he would know who is touching him and what kind of woman she is--that she is a sinner."

Jesus answered him, "Simon, I have something to tell you."

"Tell me, teacher," he said.

"Two people owed money to a certain moneylender.

One owed him five hundred denarii, and the other fifty.

Neither of them had the money to pay him back, so he forgave the debts of both.

Now which of them will love him more?"

Simon replied, "I suppose the one who had the bigger debt forgiven."

"You have judged correctly," Jesus said.

Then he turned toward the woman and said to Simon, "Do you see this woman?

I came into your house.

You did not give me any water for my feet, but she wet my feet with her tears and wiped them with her hair.

You did not give me a kiss, but this woman, from the time I entered, has not stopped kissing my feet.

You did not put oil on my head, but she has poured perfume on my feet.

Therefore, I tell you, her many sins have been forgiven--as her great love has shown.

But whoever has been forgiven little loves little."

Then Jesus said to her, "Your sins are forgiven."

The other guests began to say among themselves, "Who is this who even forgives sins?"

Jesus said to the woman, "Your faith has saved you; go in peace."

## Luke 8

One day, Jesus was traveling from town to town, spreading the message of God's kingdom.

The twelve disciples were with him, along with some women who had been healed of evil spirits and illnesses.

Among them was Mary Magdalene, from whom seven demons had been cast out, Joanna, the wife of Herod's steward Chuza, Susanna, and many others who supported them with their resources.

A large crowd gathered, and people from different towns came to see him.

Jesus told them a parable: "A farmer went out to sow his seed.

As he was scattering the seed, some fell along the path, where it was trampled on, and the birds ate it up.

Some fell on rocky ground, and when it came up, the plants withered because they had no moisture.

Other seed fell among thorns, which grew up with it and choked the plants.

Still other seed fell on good soil.

It came up and yielded a crop, a hundred times more than was sown."

After telling the parable, Jesus said, "Whoever has ears to hear, let them hear."

His disciples asked him what the parable meant.

He replied, "The knowledge of the secrets of the kingdom of God has been given to you, but to others I speak in parables, so that, 'though seeing, they may not see; though hearing, they may not understand.'

"This is the meaning of the parable: The seed is the word of God.

Those along the path are the ones who hear, and then the devil comes and takes away the word from their hearts, so that they may not believe and be saved.

Those on the rocky ground are the ones who receive the word with joy when they hear it, but they have no root.

They believe for a while, but in the time of testing, they fall away.

The seed that fell among thorns stands for those who hear, but as they go on their way, they are choked by life's worries, riches, and pleasures, and they do not mature.

But the seed on good soil stands for those with a noble and good heart, who hear the word, retain it, and by persevering produce a crop.

"No one lights a lamp and hides it in a jar or puts it under a bed.

Instead, they put it on a stand, so that those who come in can see the light.

For there is nothing hidden that will not be disclosed, and nothing concealed that will not be known or brought out into the open.

Therefore consider carefully how you listen.

Whoever has will be given more; whoever does not have, even what they think they have will be taken from them."

Jesus' mother and brothers came to see him, but they could not get near him because of the crowd.

Someone told him, "Your mother and brothers are standing outside, wanting to see you."

He replied, "My mother and brothers are those who hear God's word and put it into practice."

One day, Jesus got into a boat with his disciples and said, "Let's go over to the other side of the lake."

As they sailed, he fell asleep.

A storm came down on the lake, so that the boat was being swamped, and they were in great danger.

The disciples went and woke him, saying, "Master, Master, we're going to drown!"

He got up and rebuked the wind and the raging waters; the storm subsided, and all was calm.

"Where is your faith?" he asked his disciples.

In fear and amazement, they asked one another, "Who is this? He commands even the winds and the water, and they obey him."

They sailed to the region of the Gerasenes, which is across the lake from Galilee.

When Jesus stepped ashore, he was met by a demon-possessed man from the town.

For a long time, this man had not worn clothes or lived in a house, but had lived in the tombs.

When he saw Jesus, he cried out and fell at his feet, shouting at the top of his voice, "What do you want with me, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I beg you, don't torture me!"

For Jesus had commanded the impure spirit to come out of the man.

Many times it had seized him, and though he was chained hand and foot and kept under guard, he had broken his chains and had been driven by the demon into solitary places.

Jesus asked him, "What is your name?"

"Legion," he replied, because many demons had gone into him.

And they begged Jesus repeatedly not to order them to go into the Abyss.

A large herd of pigs was feeding there on the hillside.

The demons begged Jesus to let them go into the pigs, and he gave them permission.

When the demons came out of the man, they went into the pigs, and the herd rushed down the steep bank into the lake and was drowned.

When those tending the pigs saw what had happened, they ran off and reported this in the town and countryside, and the people went out to see what had happened.

When they came to Jesus, they found the man from whom the demons had gone out, sitting at Jesus' feet, dressed and in his right mind; and they were afraid.

Those who had seen it told the people how the demon-possessed man had been cured.

Then all the people of the region of the Gerasenes asked Jesus to leave them, because they were overcome with fear.

So he got into the boat and left.

The man from whom the demons had gone out begged to go with him, but Jesus sent him away, saying, "Return home and tell how much God has done for you."

So the man went away and told all over town how much Jesus had done for him.

When Jesus returned, a crowd welcomed him, for they were all expecting him.

Then a man named Jairus, a synagogue leader, came and fell at Jesus' feet, pleading with him to come to his house because his only daughter, a girl of about twelve, was dying.

As Jesus was on his way, the crowds almost crushed him.

And a woman was there who had been subject to bleeding for twelve years, but no one could heal her.

She came up behind him and touched the edge of his cloak, and immediately her bleeding stopped.

"Who touched me?" Jesus asked.

When they all denied it, Peter said, "Master, the people are crowding and pressing against you."

But Jesus said, "Someone touched me; I know that power has gone out from me."

Then the woman, seeing that she could not go unnoticed, came trembling and fell at his feet.

In the presence of all the people, she told why she had touched him and how she had been instantly healed.

Then he said to her, "Daughter, your faith has healed you.

Go in peace."

While Jesus was still speaking, someone came from the house of Jairus, the synagogue leader.

"Your daughter is dead," he said.

"Don't bother the teacher anymore."

Hearing this, Jesus said to Jairus, "Don't be afraid; just believe, and she will be healed."

When he arrived at the house of Jairus, he did not let anyone go in with him except Peter, John, and James, and the child's father and mother.

Meanwhile, all the people were wailing and mourning for her.

"Stop wailing," Jesus said.

"She is not dead but asleep."

They laughed at him, knowing that she was dead.

But he took her by the hand and said, "My child, get up!"

Her spirit returned, and at once she stood up.

Then Jesus told them to give her something to eat.

Her parents were astonished, but he ordered them not to tell anyone what had happened.

## Luke 9

Jesus called his twelve disciples together and gave them power and authority to drive out all demons and to cure diseases.

He sent them out to proclaim the kingdom of God and to heal the sick.

He told them, "Take nothing for the journey--no staff, no bag, no bread, no money, no extra shirt.

Whatever house you enter, stay there until you leave that town.

If people do not welcome you, leave their town and shake the dust off your feet as a testimony against them."

So they set out and went from village to village, proclaiming the good news and healing people everywhere.

Herod the tetrarch heard about all that was happening, and he was perplexed because some were saying that John had been raised from the dead, others that Elijah had appeared, and still others that one of the prophets of long ago had come back to life.

But Herod said, "I beheaded John.

Who, then, is this I hear such things about?"

And he tried to see him.

When the apostles returned, they reported to Jesus what they had done.

Then he took them with him and they withdrew by themselves to a town called Bethsaida, but the crowds learned about it and followed him.

He welcomed them and spoke to them about the kingdom of God, and healed those who needed healing.

Late in the afternoon, the Twelve came to him and said, "Send the crowd away so they can go to the surrounding villages and countryside and find food and lodging, because we are in a remote place here."

He replied, "You give them something to eat."

They answered, "We have only five loaves of bread and two fish--unless we go and buy food for all this crowd."

(About five thousand men were there.)

But he said to his disciples, "Have them sit down in groups of about fifty each."

The disciples did so, and everyone sat down.

Taking the five loaves and the two fish and looking up to heaven, he gave thanks and broke them.

Then he gave them to the disciples to distribute to the people.

They all ate and were satisfied, and the disciples picked up twelve basketfuls of broken pieces that were left over.

Once when Jesus was praying in private and his disciples were with him, he asked them, "Who do the crowds say I am?"

They replied, "Some say John the Baptist; others say Elijah; and still others, that one of the prophets of long ago has come back to life."

"But what about you?" he asked.

"Who do you say I am?"

Peter answered, "God's Messiah."

Jesus strictly warned them not to tell this to anyone.

And he said, "The Son of Man must suffer many things and be rejected by the elders, the chief priests and the teachers of the law, and he must be killed and on the third day be raised to life."

Then he said to them all: "Whoever wants to be my disciple must deny themselves and take up their cross daily and follow me.

For whoever wants to save their life will lose it, but whoever loses their life for me will save it.

What good is it for someone to gain the whole world, and yet lose or forfeit their very self?

Whoever is ashamed of me and my words, the Son of Man will be ashamed of them when he comes in his glory and in the glory of the Father and of the holy angels.

Truly I tell you, some who are standing here will not taste death before they see the kingdom of God."

About eight days after Jesus said this, he took Peter, John and James with him and went up onto a mountain to pray.

As he was praying, the appearance of his face changed, and his clothes became as bright as a flash of lightning.

Two men, Moses and Elijah, appeared in glorious splendor, talking with Jesus.

They spoke about his departure, which he was about to bring to fulfillment at Jerusalem.

Peter and his companions were very sleepy, but when they became fully awake, they saw his glory and the two men standing with him.

As the men were leaving Jesus, Peter said to him, "Master, it is good for us to be here.

Let us put up three shelters--one for you, one for Moses and one for Elijah."

(He did not know what he was saying.)

While he was speaking, a cloud appeared and covered them, and they were afraid as they entered the cloud.

A voice came from the cloud, saying, "This is my Son, whom I have chosen; listen to him."

When the voice had spoken, they found that Jesus was alone.

The disciples kept this to themselves and did not tell anyone at that time what they had seen.

The next day, when they came down from the mountain, a large crowd met him.

A man in the crowd called out, "Teacher, I beg you to look at my son, for he is my only child.

A spirit seizes him and he suddenly screams; it throws him into convulsions so that he foams at the mouth.

It scarcely ever leaves him and is destroying him.

I begged your disciples to drive it out, but they could not."

"You unbelieving and perverse generation," Jesus replied, "how long shall I stay with you and put up with you?

Bring your son here."

Even while the boy was coming, the demon threw him to the ground in a convulsion.

But Jesus rebuked the impure spirit, healed the boy and gave him back to his father.

And they were all amazed at the greatness of God.

While everyone was marveling at all that Jesus did, he said to his disciples, "Listen carefully to what I am about to tell you: The Son of Man is going to be delivered into the hands of men."

But they did not understand what this meant.

It was hidden from them, so that they did not grasp it, and they were afraid to ask him about it.

An argument started among the disciples as to which of them would be the greatest.

Jesus, knowing their thoughts, took a little child and had him stand beside him.

Then he said to them, "Whoever welcomes this little child in my name welcomes me; and whoever welcomes me welcomes the one who sent me.

For it is the one who is least among you all who is the greatest."

"Master," said John, "we saw someone driving out demons in your name and we tried to stop him, because he is not one of us."

"Do not stop him," Jesus said, "for whoever is not against you is for you."

As the time approached for him to be taken up to heaven, Jesus resolutely set out for Jerusalem.

And he sent messengers on ahead, who went into a Samaritan village to get things ready for him; but the people there did not welcome him, because he was heading for Jerusalem.

When the disciples James and John saw this, they asked, "Lord, do you want us to call fire down from heaven to destroy them?"

But Jesus turned and rebuked them.

Then he and his disciples went to another village.

As they were walking along the road, a man said to him, "I will follow you wherever you go."

Jesus replied, "Foxes have dens and birds have nests, but the Son of Man has no place to lay his head."

He said to another man, "Follow me."

But he replied, "Lord, first let me go and bury my father."

Jesus said to him, "Let the dead bury their own dead, but you go and proclaim the kingdom of God."

Still another said, "I will follow you, Lord; but first let me go back and say goodbye to my family."

Jesus replied, "No one who puts a hand to the plow and looks back is fit for service in the kingdom of God."

## Luke 10

After this, the Lord chose seventy-two others and sent them out in pairs to every town and place he was about to visit.

He told them, "The harvest is plentiful, but the workers are few.

Ask the Lord of the harvest to send out workers into his harvest field.

Go! I am sending you out like lambs among wolves.

Do not take a purse or bag or sandals, and do not greet anyone on the road.

When you enter a house, first say, 'Peace to this house.'

If someone who promotes peace is there, your peace will rest on them; if not, it will return to you.

Stay there, eating and drinking whatever they give you, for the worker deserves his wages.

Do not move around from house to house.

When you enter a town and are welcomed, eat what is offered to you.

Heal the sick who are there and tell them, 'The kingdom of God has come near to you.'

But when you enter a town and are not welcomed, go into its streets and say, 'Even the dust of your town we wipe from our feet as a warning to you.

Yet be sure of this: The kingdom of God has come near.'

I tell you, it will be more bearable on that day for Sodom than for that town.

Woe to you, Chorazin!

Woe to you, Bethsaida!

For if the miracles that were performed in you had been performed in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago, sitting in sackcloth and ashes.

But it will be more bearable for Tyre and Sidon at the judgment than for you.

And you, Capernaum, will you be lifted to the heavens?

No, you will go down to Hades.

Whoever listens to you listens to me; whoever rejects you rejects me; but whoever rejects me rejects him who sent me."

The seventy-two returned with joy and said, "Lord, even the demons submit to us in your name."

He replied, "I saw Satan fall like lightning from heaven.

I have given you authority to trample on snakes and scorpions and to overcome all the power of the enemy; nothing will harm you.

However, do not rejoice that the spirits submit to you, but rejoice that your names are written in heaven."

At that time Jesus, full of joy through the Holy Spirit, said, "I praise you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because you have hidden these things from the wise and learned, and revealed them to little children.

Yes, Father, for this is what you were pleased to do.

All things have been committed to me by my Father.

No one knows who the Son is except the Father, and no one knows who the Father is except the Son and those to whom the Son chooses to reveal him."

Then he turned to his disciples and said privately, "Blessed are the eyes that see what you see.

For I tell you that many prophets and kings wanted to see what you see but did not see it, and to hear what you hear but did not hear it."

On one occasion an expert in the law stood up to test Jesus.

"Teacher," he asked, "what must I do to inherit eternal life?"

"What is written in the Law?" he replied.

"How do you read it?"

He answered, "'Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength and with all your mind'; and, 'Love your neighbor as yourself.'"

"You have answered correctly," Jesus replied.

"Do this and you will live."

But he wanted to justify himself, so he asked Jesus, "And who is my neighbor?"

In reply Jesus said: "A man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho, when he was attacked by robbers.

They stripped him of his clothes, beat him and went away, leaving him half dead.

A priest happened to be going down the same road, and when he saw the man, he passed by on the other side.

So too, a Levite, when he came to the place and saw him, passed by on the other side.

But a Samaritan, as he traveled, came where the man was; and when he saw him, he took pity on him.

He went to him and bandaged his wounds, pouring on oil and wine.

Then he put the man on his own donkey, brought him to an inn and took care of him.

The next day he took out two denarii and gave them to the innkeeper.

'Look after him,' he said, 'and when I return, I will reimburse you for any extra expense you may have.'

"Which of these three do you think was a neighbor to the man who fell into the hands of robbers?"

The expert in the law replied, "The one who had mercy on him."

Jesus told him, "Go and do likewise."

As Jesus and his disciples were on their way, he came to a village where a woman named Martha opened her home to him.

She had a sister called Mary, who sat at the Lord's feet listening to what he said.

But Martha was distracted by all the preparations that had to be made.

She came to him and asked, "Lord, don't you care that my sister has left me to do the work by myself?

Tell her to help me!"

"Martha, Martha," the Lord answered, "you are worried and upset about many things, but few things are needed--or indeed only one.

Mary has chosen what is better, and it will not be taken away from her."

## Luke 11

One day, while Jesus was praying in a certain place, one of his disciples asked him, "Lord, teach us to pray, just as John taught his disciples."

Jesus replied, "When you pray, say: 'Father, may your name be kept holy.

May your kingdom come.

Give us each day the food we need.

Forgive us our sins, as we forgive those who sin against us.

And don't let us fall into temptation.'"

Then Jesus told them a story: "Suppose one of you has a friend, and you go to him at midnight and say, 'Friend, lend me three loaves of bread, because a friend of mine has come to visit, and I have nothing to offer him.'

And suppose the friend answers from inside, 'Don't bother me.

The door is already locked, and my children and I are in bed.

I can't get up and give you anything.'

I tell you, even if he won't get up and give you the bread because of friendship, he will get up and give you whatever you need because of your persistence.

So I say to you: Ask, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock, and the door will be opened to you.

For everyone who asks receives; the one who seeks finds; and to the one who knocks, the door will be opened.

Which of you fathers, if your son asks for a fish, will give him a snake instead?

Or if he asks for an egg, will give him a scorpion?

If you, then, who are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father in heaven give the Holy Spirit to those who ask him!"

Jesus was driving out a demon that was mute.

When the demon left, the man who had been mute spoke, and the crowd was amazed.

But some of them said, "By Beelzebul, the prince of demons, he is driving out demons."

Others tested him by asking for a sign from heaven.

Jesus knew their thoughts and said to them, "Any kingdom divided against itself will be ruined, and a house divided against itself will fall.

If Satan is divided against himself, how can his kingdom stand?

I say this because you claim that I drive out demons by Beelzebul.

Now if I drive out demons by Beelzebul, by whom do your followers drive them out?

So then, they will be your judges.

But if I drive out demons by the finger of God, then the kingdom of God has come upon you.

When a strong man, fully armed, guards his own house, his possessions are safe.

But when someone stronger attacks and overpowers him, he takes away the armor in which the man trusted and divides up his plunder.

Whoever is not with me is against me, and whoever does not gather with me scatters.

When an impure spirit comes out of a person, it goes through arid places seeking rest and does not find it.

Then it says, 'I will return to the house I left.'

When it arrives, it finds the house swept clean and put in order.

Then it goes and takes seven other spirits more wicked than itself, and they go in and live there.

And the final condition of that person is worse than the first."

As Jesus was saying these things, a woman in the crowd called out, "Blessed is the mother who gave you birth and nursed you."

He replied, "Blessed rather are those who hear the word of God and obey it."

As the crowds increased, Jesus said, "This is a wicked generation.

It asks for a sign, but none will be given it except the sign of Jonah.

For as Jonah was a sign to the Ninevites, so also will the Son of Man be to this generation.

The Queen of the South will rise at the judgment with the people of this generation and condemn them; for she came from the ends of the earth to listen to Solomon's wisdom, and now something greater than Solomon is here.

The people of Nineveh will stand up at the judgment with this generation and condemn it; for they repented at the preaching of Jonah, and now something greater than Jonah is here.

No one lights a lamp and puts it in a place where it will be hidden, or under a bowl.

Instead, they put it on its stand, so that those who come in may see the light.

Your eye is the lamp of your body.

When your eyes are healthy, your whole body also is full of light.

But when they are unhealthy, your body also is full of darkness.

See to it, then, that the light within you is not darkness.

Therefore, if your whole body is full of light, and no part of it dark, it will be just as full of light as when a lamp shines its light on you."

When Jesus had finished speaking, a Pharisee invited him to eat with him; so he went in and reclined at the table.

But the Pharisee was surprised when he noticed that Jesus did not first wash before the meal.

Then the Lord said to him, "Now then, you Pharisees clean the outside of the cup and dish, but inside you are full of greed and wickedness.

You foolish people!

Did not the one who made the outside make the inside also?

But now as for what is inside you--be generous to the poor, and everything will be clean for you.

Woe to you Pharisees, because you give God a tenth of your mint, rue and all other kinds of garden herbs, but you neglect justice and the love of God.

You should have practiced the latter without leaving the former undone.

Woe to you Pharisees, because you love the most important seats in the synagogues and respectful greetings in the marketplaces.

Woe to you, because you are like unmarked graves, which people walk over without knowing it."

One of the experts in the law answered him, "Teacher, when you say these things, you insult us also."

Jesus replied, "And you experts in the law, woe to you, because you load people down with burdens they can hardly carry, and you yourselves will not lift one finger to help them.

Woe to you, because you build tombs for the prophets, and it was your ancestors who killed them.

So you testify that you approve of what your ancestors did; they killed the prophets, and you build their tombs.

Because of this, God in his wisdom said, 'I will send them prophets and apostles, some of whom they will kill and others they will persecute.'

Therefore this generation will be held responsible for the blood of all the prophets that has been shed since the beginning of the world, from the blood of Abel to the blood of Zechariah, who was killed between the altar and the sanctuary.

Yes, I tell you, this generation will be held responsible for it all.

Woe to you experts in the law, because you have taken away the key to knowledge.

You yourselves have not entered, and you have hindered those who were entering."

When Jesus went outside, the Pharisees and the teachers of the law began to oppose him fiercely and to besiege him with questions, waiting to catch him in something he might say.

## Luke 12

When a huge crowd gathered, so many that they were stepping on each other, Jesus began to speak to his disciples.

He warned them to be careful of the Pharisees' hypocrisy.

He said that nothing hidden will stay hidden, and everything said in the dark will be heard in the light.

He told them not to fear those who can kill the body but can't do anything more.

Instead, they should fear God, who has the power to throw them into hell after death.

Jesus reassured them that God cares for them more than sparrows, and even the hairs on their heads are counted.

He encouraged them to acknowledge him before others, and he would acknowledge them before God's angels.

But those who deny him will be denied before the angels.

He also said that anyone who speaks against him will be forgiven, but blaspheming against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven.

When they are brought before authorities, they shouldn't worry about what to say because the Holy Spirit will teach them what to say at that moment.

Someone in the crowd asked Jesus to tell his brother to share the inheritance with him.

Jesus replied that he wasn't appointed as a judge over them.

He warned them to be on guard against greed because life isn't about having lots of possessions.

He told a parable about a rich man whose land produced a lot.

The man decided to tear down his barns and build bigger ones to store all his grain and goods.

He thought he could relax and enjoy life, but God told him that he would die that night, and then who would get what he had prepared?

Jesus told his disciples not to worry about their lives, what they would eat, or what they would wear.

Life is more than food, and the body is more than clothes.

He pointed out that God feeds the ravens and clothes the lilies, so they shouldn't worry because they are more valuable than birds.

He encouraged them to seek God's kingdom, and everything else would be given to them.

He told them to sell their possessions and give to the poor, storing up treasure in heaven where it can't be stolen or destroyed.

He advised them to be ready and watchful, like servants waiting for their master to return from a wedding banquet.

Blessed are those servants whom the master finds watching when he comes.

Jesus said he came to bring fire on the earth and wished it were already kindled.

He spoke of a baptism he had to undergo and how he was distressed until it was completed.

He said he didn't come to bring peace but division, with families divided against each other.

He criticized the crowd for being able to interpret the weather but not understanding the present time.

He urged them to settle matters quickly with their adversary before they are taken to court, or they might be thrown into prison until they pay the last penny.

## Luke 13

Some people came to Jesus and told him about the Galileans whose blood Pilate had mixed with their sacrifices.

Jesus replied, "Do you think these Galileans were worse sinners than all the other Galileans because they suffered this way?

No, I tell you.

But unless you repent, you too will all perish.

Or those eighteen who died when the tower in Siloam fell on them--do you think they were more guilty than all the others living in Jerusalem?

I tell you, no!

But unless you repent, you too will all perish."

Then he told this parable: "A man had a fig tree growing in his vineyard, and he went to look for fruit on it but did not find any.

So he said to the man who took care of the vineyard, 'For three years now I've been coming to look for fruit on this fig tree and haven't found any.

Cut it down!

Why should it use up the soil?'

'Sir,' the man replied, 'leave it alone for one more year, and I'll dig around it and fertilize it.

If it bears fruit next year, fine!

If not, then cut it down.'"

On a Sabbath, Jesus was teaching in one of the synagogues, and a woman was there who had been crippled by a spirit for eighteen years.

She was bent over and could not straighten up at all.

When Jesus saw her, he called her forward and said to her, "Woman, you are set free from your infirmity."

Then he put his hands on her, and immediately she straightened up and praised God.

Indignant because Jesus had healed on the Sabbath, the synagogue leader said to the people, "There are six days for work.

So come and be healed on those days, not on the Sabbath."

The Lord answered him, "You hypocrites!

Doesn't each of you on the Sabbath untie your ox or donkey from the stall and lead it out to give it water?

Then should not this woman, a daughter of Abraham, whom Satan has kept bound for eighteen long years, be set free on the Sabbath day from what bound her?"

When he said this, all his opponents were humiliated, but the people were delighted with all the wonderful things he was doing.

Then Jesus asked, "What is the kingdom of God like?

What shall I compare it to?

It is like a mustard seed, which a man took and planted in his garden.

It grew and became a tree, and the birds perched in its branches."

Again he asked, "What shall I compare the kingdom of God to?

It is like yeast that a woman took and mixed into about sixty pounds of flour until it worked all through the dough."

Then Jesus went through the towns and villages, teaching as he made his way to Jerusalem.

Someone asked him, "Lord, are only a few people going to be saved?"

He said to them, "Make every effort to enter through the narrow door, because many, I tell you, will try to enter and will not be able to.

Once the owner of the house gets up and closes the door, you will stand outside knocking and pleading, 'Sir, open the door for us.'

But he will answer, 'I don't know you or where you come from.'

Then you will say, 'We ate and drank with you, and you taught in our streets.'

But he will reply, 'I don't know you or where you come from.

Away from me, all you evildoers!'

There will be weeping there, and gnashing of teeth, when you see Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob and all the prophets in the kingdom of God, but you yourselves thrown out.

People will come from east and west and north and south, and will take their places at the feast in the kingdom of God.

Indeed there are those who are last who will be first, and first who will be last."

At that time some Pharisees came to Jesus and said to him, "Leave this place and go somewhere else.

Herod wants to kill you."

He replied, "Go tell that fox, 'I will keep on driving out demons and healing people today and tomorrow, and on the third day I will reach my goal.'

In any case, I must press on today and tomorrow and the next day--for surely no prophet can die outside Jerusalem!

"Jerusalem, Jerusalem, you who kill the prophets and stone those sent to you, how often I have longed to gather your children together, as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings, and you were not willing.

Look, your house is left to you desolate.

I tell you, you will not see me again until you say, 'Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.'"

## Luke 14

One day, Jesus went to the house of a Pharisee leader to eat bread on the Sabbath, and people were watching him closely.

A man with a disease was there in front of him.

Jesus asked the legal experts and Pharisees, "Is it allowed to heal on the Sabbath or not?"

They didn't answer, so Jesus healed the man and sent him away.

Then Jesus said to them, "If your son or an ox falls into a well on the Sabbath, wouldn't you immediately pull him out?"

They couldn't reply to this.

Jesus also told a story to the guests about choosing the best seats.

He said, "When you're invited to a wedding, don't sit in the best seat.

Someone more important might be invited, and the host will ask you to move, and you'll be embarrassed.

Instead, sit in the least important place, so the host might say, 'Friend, move up to a better place.'

Then you'll be honored in front of everyone.

For everyone who exalts themselves will be humbled, and those who humble themselves will be exalted."

He also told the host, "When you give a lunch or dinner, don't invite your friends, brothers, relatives, or rich neighbors, because they might invite you back, and you'll be repaid.

Instead, invite the poor, the crippled, the lame, and the blind, and you'll be blessed because they can't repay you.

You'll be repaid at the resurrection of the righteous."

Hearing this, one of the guests said, "Blessed is the one who will eat at the feast in the kingdom of God."

Jesus replied, "A man was preparing a great banquet and invited many guests.

When it was time for the banquet, he sent his servant to tell those invited, 'Come, everything is ready.'

But they all began to make excuses.

One said, 'I just bought a field and need to go see it. Please excuse me.'

Another said, 'I just bought five pairs of oxen and am on my way to try them out. Please excuse me.'

Another said, 'I just got married, so I can't come.'

The servant returned and reported this to his master.

The owner of the house became angry and ordered his servant, 'Go out quickly into the streets and alleys of the town and bring in the poor, the crippled, the blind, and the lame.'

The servant said, 'Sir, what you ordered has been done, but there is still room.'

Then the master told his servant, 'Go out to the roads and country lanes and compel them to come in, so that my house will be full.

I tell you, not one of those who were invited will get a taste of my banquet.'

Large crowds were traveling with Jesus, and he turned to them and said, "If anyone comes to me and does not hate their father and mother, wife and children, brothers and sisters--yes, even their own life--such a person cannot be my disciple.

Whoever does not carry their cross and follow me cannot be my disciple.

Suppose one of you wants to build a tower.

Won't you first sit down and estimate the cost to see if you have enough money to complete it?

For if you lay the foundation and are not able to finish it, everyone who sees it will ridicule you, saying, 'This person began to build and wasn't able to finish.'

Or suppose a king is about to go to war against another king.

Won't he first sit down and consider whether he is able with ten thousand men to oppose the one coming against him with twenty thousand?

If he is not able, he will send a delegation while the other is still a long way off and will ask for terms of peace.

In the same way, those of you who do not give up everything you have cannot be my disciples.

Salt is good, but if it loses its saltiness, how can it be made salty again?

It is fit neither for the soil nor for the manure pile; it is thrown out.

Whoever has ears to hear, let them hear.

## Luke 15

All the tax collectors and sinners were coming to listen to him.

But the Pharisees and the teachers of the law were complaining, saying, "This man welcomes sinners and eats with them."

So he told them this story: "Suppose one of you has a hundred sheep and loses one of them.

Wouldn't you leave the ninety-nine in the open country and go after the lost sheep until you find it?

And when you find it, you joyfully put it on your shoulders and go home.

Then you call your friends and neighbors together and say, 'Rejoice with me; I have found my lost sheep.'

I tell you that in the same way there will be more joy in heaven over one sinner who repents than over ninety-nine righteous people who do not need to repent.

Or suppose a woman has ten silver coins and loses one.

Doesn't she light a lamp, sweep the house, and search carefully until she finds it?

And when she finds it, she calls her friends and neighbors together and says, 'Rejoice with me; I have found my lost coin.'

In the same way, I tell you, there is rejoicing in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner who repents.

Jesus continued: "There was a man who had two sons.

The younger one said to his father, 'Father, give me my share of the estate.'

So he divided his property between them.

Not long after that, the younger son got together all he had, set off for a distant country, and there squandered his wealth in wild living.

After he had spent everything, there was a severe famine in that whole country, and he began to be in need.

So he went and hired himself out to a citizen of that country, who sent him to his fields to feed pigs.

He longed to fill his stomach with the pods that the pigs were eating, but no one gave him anything.

When he came to his senses, he said, 'How many of my father's hired servants have food to spare, and here I am starving to death!

I will set out and go back to my father and say to him: Father, I have sinned against heaven and against you.

I am no longer worthy to be called your son; make me like one of your hired servants.'

So he got up and went to his father.

But while he was still a long way off, his father saw him and was filled with compassion for him; he ran to his son, threw his arms around him, and kissed him.

The son said to him, 'Father, I have sinned against heaven and against you.

I am no longer worthy to be called your son.'

But the father said to his servants, 'Quick! Bring the best robe and put it on him.

Put a ring on his finger and sandals on his feet.

Bring the fattened calf and kill it.

Let's have a feast and celebrate.

For this son of mine was dead and is alive again; he was lost and is found.'

So they began to celebrate.

Meanwhile, the older son was in the field.

When he came near the house, he heard music and dancing.

So he called one of the servants and asked him what was going on.

'Your brother has come,' he replied, 'and your father has killed the fattened calf because he has him back safe and sound.'

The older brother became angry and refused to go in.

So his father went out and pleaded with him.

But he answered his father, 'Look! All these years I've been slaving for you and never disobeyed your orders.

Yet you never gave me even a young goat so I could celebrate with my friends.

But when this son of yours who has squandered your property with prostitutes comes home, you kill the fattened calf for him!'

'"My son,' the father said, 'you are always with me, and everything I have is yours.

But we had to celebrate and be glad, because this brother of yours was dead and is alive again; he was lost and is found.'"

## Luke 16

A rich man had a manager who was accused of wasting his possessions.

The rich man called the manager and said, "What is this I hear about you?

Give an account of your management, because you cannot be manager any longer."

The manager thought to himself, "What shall I do now?

My master is taking away my job.

I'm not strong enough to dig, and I'm ashamed to beg.

I know what I'll do so that, when I lose my job here, people will welcome me into their houses."

So he called in each one of his master's debtors.

He asked the first, "How much do you owe my master?"

"Nine hundred gallons of olive oil," he replied.

The manager told him, "Take your bill, sit down quickly, and make it four hundred and fifty."

Then he asked the second, "And how much do you owe?"

"A thousand bushels of wheat," he replied.

He told him, "Take your bill and make it eight hundred."

The master commended the dishonest manager because he had acted shrewdly.

For the people of this world are more shrewd in dealing with their own kind than are the people of the light.

I tell you, use worldly wealth to gain friends for yourselves, so that when it is gone, you will be welcomed into eternal dwellings.

Whoever can be trusted with very little can also be trusted with much, and whoever is dishonest with very little will also be dishonest with much.

So if you have not been trustworthy in handling worldly wealth, who will trust you with true riches?

And if you have not been trustworthy with someone else's property, who will give you property of your own?

No one can serve two masters.

Either you will hate the one and love the other, or you will be devoted to the one and despise the other.

You cannot serve both God and money.

The Pharisees, who loved money, heard all this and were sneering at Jesus.

He said to them, "You are the ones who justify yourselves in the eyes of others, but God knows your hearts.

What people value highly is detestable in God's sight.

The Law and the Prophets were proclaimed until John.

Since that time, the good news of the kingdom of God is being preached, and everyone is forcing their way into it.

It is easier for heaven and earth to disappear than for the least stroke of a pen to drop out of the Law.

Anyone who divorces his wife and marries another woman commits adultery, and the man who marries a divorced woman commits adultery.

There was a rich man who was dressed in purple and fine linen and lived in luxury every day.

At his gate was laid a beggar named Lazarus, covered with sores and longing to eat what fell from the rich man's table.

Even the dogs came and licked his sores.

The time came when the beggar died and the angels carried him to Abraham's side.

The rich man also died and was buried.

In Hades, where he was in torment, he looked up and saw Abraham far away, with Lazarus by his side.

So he called to him, "Father Abraham, have pity on me and send Lazarus to dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue, because I am in agony in this fire."

But Abraham replied, "Son, remember that in your lifetime you received your good things, while Lazarus received bad things, but now he is comforted here and you are in agony.

And besides all this, between us and you a great chasm has been set in place, so that those who want to go from here to you cannot, nor can anyone cross over from there to us."

He answered, "Then I beg you, father, send Lazarus to my family, for I have five brothers.

Let him warn them, so that they will not also come to this place of torment."

Abraham replied, "They have Moses and the Prophets; let them listen to them."

"No, father Abraham," he said, "but if someone from the dead goes to them, they will repent."

He said to him, "If they do not listen to Moses and the Prophets, they will not be convinced even if someone rises from the dead."

## Luke 17

Jesus told his followers, "It's impossible for problems not to come, but it's bad for the person who causes them.

It would be better for them to have a heavy stone tied around their neck and be thrown into the sea than to cause one of these little ones to stumble.

Be careful!

If your brother sins, correct him, and if he repents, forgive him.

Even if he sins against you seven times in a day and comes back to you saying, 'I repent,' forgive him."

The apostles said to the Lord, "Increase our faith!"

Jesus replied, "If you have faith as small as a mustard seed, you can say to this mulberry tree, 'Be uprooted and planted in the sea,' and it will obey you.

"Suppose one of you has a servant plowing or looking after the sheep.

Will you say to the servant when he comes in from the field, 'Come along now and sit down to eat'?

Won't you rather say, 'Prepare my supper, get yourself ready and wait on me while I eat and drink; after that you may eat and drink'?

Will he thank the servant because he did what he was told to do?

So you also, when you have done everything you were told to do, should say, 'We are unworthy servants; we have only done our duty.'"

As Jesus was on his way to Jerusalem, he traveled along the border between Samaria and Galilee.

As he was going into a village, ten men who had leprosy met him.

They stood at a distance and called out in a loud voice, "Jesus, Master, have pity on us!"

When he saw them, he said, "Go, show yourselves to the priests."

And as they went, they were cleansed.

One of them, when he saw he was healed, came back, praising God in a loud voice.

He threw himself at Jesus' feet and thanked him--and he was a Samaritan.

Jesus asked, "Were not all ten cleansed?

Where are the other nine?

Has no one returned to give praise to God except this foreigner?"

Then he said to him, "Rise and go; your faith has made you well."

Once, having been asked by the Pharisees when the kingdom of God would come, Jesus replied, "The coming of the kingdom of God is not something that can be observed, nor will people say, 'Here it is,' or 'There it is,' because the kingdom of God is in your midst."

Then he said to his disciples, "The time is coming when you will long to see one of the days of the Son of Man, but you will not see it.

People will tell you, 'There he is!' or 'Here he is!'

Do not go running off after them.

For the Son of Man in his day will be like the lightning, which flashes and lights up the sky from one end to the other.

But first he must suffer many things and be rejected by this generation.

"Just as it was in the days of Noah, so also will it be in the days of the Son of Man.

People were eating, drinking, marrying and being given in marriage up to the day Noah entered the ark.

Then the flood came and destroyed them all.

"It was the same in the days of Lot.

People were eating and drinking, buying and selling, planting and building.

But the day Lot left Sodom, fire and sulfur rained down from heaven and destroyed them all.

"It will be just like this on the day the Son of Man is revealed.

On that day no one who is on the housetop, with possessions inside, should go down to get them.

Likewise, no one in the field should go back for anything.

Remember Lot's wife!

Whoever tries to keep their life will lose it, and whoever loses their life will preserve it.

"I tell you, on that night two people will be in one bed; one will be taken and the other left.

Two women will be grinding grain together; one will be taken and the other left."

"Where, Lord?" they asked.

He replied, "Where there is a dead body, there the vultures will gather."

## Luke 18

Jesus told a story to show that people should always pray and not give up.

He said there was a judge in a city who didn't fear God or care about people.

A widow in that city kept coming to him, asking for justice against her enemy.

For a while, he refused, but later he thought, "Even though I don't fear God or care about people, I'll give her justice so she won't keep bothering me."

Jesus said, "Listen to what the unjust judge says.

Won't God bring justice for His chosen ones who cry out to Him day and night?

He will see that they get justice quickly.

But when the Son of Man comes, will He find faith on the earth?"

Jesus also told this story to some who were confident in their own righteousness and looked down on others.

Two men went to the temple to pray, one a Pharisee and the other a tax collector.

The Pharisee stood by himself and prayed, "God, I thank you that I am not like other people--robbers, evildoers, adulterers--or even like this tax collector.

I fast twice a week and give a tenth of all I get."

But the tax collector stood at a distance.

He wouldn't even look up to heaven, but beat his chest and said, "God, have mercy on me, a sinner."

Jesus said, "I tell you that this man, rather than the other, went home justified before God.

For all those who exalt themselves will be humbled, and those who humble themselves will be exalted."

People were also bringing babies to Jesus for Him to place His hands on them.

When the disciples saw this, they rebuked them.

But Jesus called the children to Him and said, "Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of God belongs to such as these.

Truly I tell you, anyone who will not receive the kingdom of God like a little child will never enter it."

A certain ruler asked Him, "Good teacher, what must I do to inherit eternal life?"

Jesus replied, "Why do you call me good?

No one is good--except God alone.

You know the commandments: 'You shall not commit adultery, you shall not murder, you shall not steal, you shall not give false testimony, honor your father and mother.'"

"All these I have kept since I was a boy," he said.

When Jesus heard this, He said to him, "You still lack one thing.

Sell everything you have and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven.

Then come, follow me."

When he heard this, he became very sad, because he was very wealthy.

Jesus looked at him and said, "How hard it is for the rich to enter the kingdom of God!

Indeed, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of God."

Those who heard this asked, "Who then can be saved?"

Jesus replied, "What is impossible with man is possible with God."

Peter said to Him, "We have left all we had to follow you!"

"Truly I tell you," Jesus said to them, "no one who has left home or wife or brothers or sisters or parents or children for the sake of the kingdom of God will fail to receive many times as much in this age, and in the age to come eternal life."

Jesus took the Twelve aside and told them, "We are going up to Jerusalem, and everything that is written by the prophets about the Son of Man will be fulfilled.

He will be delivered over to the Gentiles.

They will mock him, insult him, and spit on him; they will flog him and kill him.

On the third day, he will rise again."

The disciples did not understand any of this.

Its meaning was hidden from them, and they did not know what He was talking about.

As Jesus approached Jericho, a blind man was sitting by the roadside begging.

When he heard the crowd going by, he asked what was happening.

They told him, "Jesus of Nazareth is passing by."

He called out, "Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!"

Those who led the way rebuked him and told him to be quiet, but he shouted all the more, "Son of David, have mercy on me!"

Jesus stopped and ordered the man to be brought to Him.

When he came near, Jesus asked him, "What do you want me to do for you?"

"Lord, I want to see," he replied.

Jesus said to him, "Receive your sight; your faith has healed you."

Immediately he received his sight and followed Jesus, praising God.

When all the people saw it, they also praised God.

## Luke 19

As Jesus was passing through Jericho, there was a man named Zacchaeus, who was a chief tax collector and very rich.

He wanted to see who Jesus was, but he couldn't because of the crowd, as he was short.

So he ran ahead and climbed a sycamore tree to see Jesus, who was going to pass that way.

When Jesus reached the spot, he looked up and said, "Zacchaeus, come down quickly, for I must stay at your house today."

Zacchaeus came down at once and welcomed him gladly.

All the people saw this and began to mutter, "He has gone to be the guest of a sinner."

But Zacchaeus stood up and said to the Lord, "Look, Lord! Here and now I give half of my possessions to the poor, and if I have cheated anybody out of anything, I will pay back four times the amount."

Jesus said to him, "Today salvation has come to this house, because this man, too, is a son of Abraham.

For the Son of Man came to seek and to save the lost."

While they were listening to this, Jesus went on to tell them a parable, because he was near Jerusalem and the people thought that the kingdom of God was going to appear at once.

He said, "A man of noble birth went to a distant country to have himself appointed king and then to return.

So he called ten of his servants and gave them ten minas.

'Put this money to work,' he said, 'until I come back.'

But his subjects hated him and sent a delegation after him to say, 'We don't want this man to be our king.'

"He was made king, however, and returned home.

Then he sent for the servants to whom he had given the money, in order to find out what they had gained with it.

The first one came and said, 'Sir, your mina has earned ten more.'

'Well done, my good servant!' his master replied.

'Because you have been trustworthy in a very small matter, take charge of ten cities.'

"The second came and said, 'Sir, your mina has earned five more.'

"His master answered, 'You take charge of five cities.'

"Then another servant came and said, 'Sir, here is your mina; I have kept it laid away in a piece of cloth.

I was afraid of you, because you are a hard man.

You take out what you did not put in and reap what you did not sow.'

"His master replied, 'I will judge you by your own words, you wicked servant!

You knew, did you, that I am a hard man, taking out what I did not put in and reaping what I did not sow?

Why then didn't you put my money on deposit, so that when I came back, I could have collected it with interest?'

"Then he said to those standing by, 'Take his mina away from him and give it to the one who has ten minas.'

'Sir,' they said, 'he already has ten!'

"He replied, 'I tell you that to everyone who has, more will be given, but as for the one who has nothing, even what they have will be taken away.

But those enemies of mine who did not want me to be king over them--bring them here and kill them in front of me.'"

After Jesus had said this, he went on ahead, going up to Jerusalem.

As he approached Bethphage and Bethany at the hill called the Mount of Olives, he sent two of his disciples, saying to them, "Go to the village ahead of you, and as you enter it, you will find a colt tied there, which no one has ever ridden.

Untie it and bring it here.

If anyone asks you, 'Why are you untying it?' say, 'The Lord needs it.'"

Those who were sent ahead went and found it just as he had told them.

As they were untying the colt, its owners asked them, "Why are you untying the colt?"

They replied, "The Lord needs it."

They brought it to Jesus, threw their cloaks on the colt, and put Jesus on it.

As he went along, people spread their cloaks on the road.

When he came near the place where the road goes down the Mount of Olives, the whole crowd of disciples began joyfully to praise God in loud voices for all the miracles they had seen:

"Blessed is the king who comes in the name of the Lord!

Peace in heaven and glory in the highest!"

Some of the Pharisees in the crowd said to Jesus, "Teacher, rebuke your disciples!"

"I tell you," he replied, "if they keep quiet, the stones will cry out."

As he approached Jerusalem and saw the city, he wept over it and said, "If you, even you, had only known on this day what would bring you peace--but now it is hidden from your eyes.

The days will come upon you when your enemies will build an embankment against you and encircle you and hem you in on every side.

They will dash you to the ground, you and the children within your walls.

They will not leave one stone on another, because you did not recognize the time of God's coming to you."

When Jesus entered the temple courts, he began to drive out those who were selling.

"It is written," he said to them, "'My house will be a house of prayer'; but you have made it 'a den of robbers.'"

Every day he was teaching at the temple.

But the chief priests, the teachers of the law and the leaders among the people were trying to kill him.

Yet they could not find any way to do it, because all the people hung on his words.

## Luke 20

One day, while Jesus was teaching the people in the temple and spreading the good news, the chief priests, scribes, and elders came up to him and asked, "Tell us, by what authority are you doing these things, or who gave you this authority?"

Jesus replied, "I will also ask you a question. Tell me, was the baptism of John from heaven or from men?"

They discussed it among themselves, saying, "If we say, 'From heaven,' he will ask, 'Why didn't you believe him?' But if we say, 'From men,' all the people will stone us, for they are convinced that John was a prophet."

So they answered that they did not know where it was from.

Jesus said to them, "Neither will I tell you by what authority I do these things."

Then he began to tell the people this parable: "A man planted a vineyard, rented it to some farmers, and went away for a long time.

At harvest time, he sent a servant to the tenants so they would give him some of the fruit of the vineyard.

But the tenants beat him and sent him away empty-handed.

He sent another servant, but they also beat and humiliated him and sent him away empty-handed.

He sent a third, and they wounded him and threw him out.

Then the owner of the vineyard said, 'What shall I do? I will send my beloved son; perhaps they will respect him.'

But when the tenants saw him, they discussed among themselves, 'This is the heir. Let's kill him so the inheritance will be ours.'

So they threw him out of the vineyard and killed him.

What then will the owner of the vineyard do to them? He will come and destroy those tenants and give the vineyard to others."

When the people heard this, they said, "May this never happen!"

Jesus looked directly at them and asked, "Then what is the meaning of that which is written: 'The stone the builders rejected has become the cornerstone'?

Everyone who falls on that stone will be broken to pieces, but anyone on whom it falls will be crushed."

The teachers of the law and the chief priests looked for a way to arrest him immediately, because they knew he had spoken this parable against them.

But they were afraid of the people.

They sent spies, who pretended to be sincere, to catch him in something he said, so they might hand him over to the power and authority of the governor.

So they questioned him, "Teacher, we know that you speak and teach what is right, and that you do not show partiality but teach the way of God in accordance with the truth.

Is it right for us to pay taxes to Caesar or not?"

Jesus saw through their trickery and said to them, "Show me a denarius.

Whose image and inscription are on it?"

"Caesar's," they replied.

He said to them, "Then give back to Caesar what is Caesar's, and to God what is God's."

They were unable to trap him in what he had said there in public.

And astonished by his answer, they became silent.

Some of the Sadducees, who say there is no resurrection, came to Jesus with a question.

"Teacher," they said, "Moses wrote for us that if a man's brother dies and leaves a wife but no children, the man must marry the widow and raise up offspring for his brother.

Now there were seven brothers.

The first one married a woman and died childless.

The second and then the third married her, and in the same way, the seven died, leaving no children.

Finally, the woman died too.

Now then, at the resurrection, whose wife will she be, since the seven were married to her?"

Jesus replied, "The people of this age marry and are given in marriage.

But those who are considered worthy of taking part in the age to come and in the resurrection from the dead will neither marry nor be given in marriage, and they can no longer die; for they are like the angels.

They are God's children, since they are children of the resurrection.

But in the account of the burning bush, even Moses showed that the dead rise, for he calls the Lord 'the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.'

He is not the God of the dead, but of the living, for to him all are alive."

Some of the teachers of the law responded, "Well said, teacher!"

And no one dared to ask him any more questions.

Then Jesus said to them, "Why is it said that the Messiah is the son of David?

David himself declares in the Book of Psalms: 'The Lord said to my Lord: "Sit at my right hand until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet."'

David calls him 'Lord.'

How then can he be his son?"

While all the people were listening, Jesus said to his disciples, "Beware of the teachers of the law.

They like to walk around in flowing robes and love to be greeted with respect in the marketplaces and have the most important seats in the synagogues and the places of honor at banquets.

They devour widows' houses and for a show make lengthy prayers.

These men will be punished most severely."

## Luke 21

He looked up and saw rich people putting their gifts into the temple treasury.

He also saw a poor widow putting in two small coins.

He said, "Truly, I tell you, this poor widow has put in more than all the others.

All these people gave their gifts out of their wealth, but she out of her poverty put in all she had to live on."

Some people were talking about the temple, how it was decorated with beautiful stones and gifts dedicated to God.

Jesus said, "As for what you see here, the time will come when not one stone will be left on another; every one of them will be thrown down."

They asked him, "Teacher, when will these things happen? And what will be the sign that they are about to take place?"

He replied, "Watch out that you are not deceived.

For many will come in my name, claiming, 'I am he,' and, 'The time is near.' Do not follow them.

When you hear of wars and uprisings, do not be frightened.

These things must happen first, but the end will not come right away."

Then he said to them, "Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom.

There will be great earthquakes, famines, and pestilences in various places, and fearful events and great signs from heaven.

But before all this, they will seize you and persecute you.

They will hand you over to synagogues and put you in prison, and you will be brought before kings and governors, and all on account of my name.

And so you will bear testimony to me.

But make up your mind not to worry beforehand how you will defend yourselves.

For I will give you words and wisdom that none of your adversaries will be able to resist or contradict.

You will be betrayed even by parents, brothers, relatives, and friends, and they will put some of you to death.

Everyone will hate you because of me.

But not a hair of your head will perish.

Stand firm, and you will win life.

When you see Jerusalem being surrounded by armies, you will know that its desolation is near.

Then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains, let those in the city get out, and let those in the country not enter the city.

For this is the time of punishment in fulfillment of all that has been written.

How dreadful it will be in those days for pregnant women and nursing mothers!

There will be great distress in the land and wrath against this people.

They will fall by the sword and will be taken as prisoners to all the nations.

Jerusalem will be trampled on by the Gentiles until the times of the Gentiles are fulfilled.

There will be signs in the sun, moon, and stars.

On the earth, nations will be in anguish and perplexity at the roaring and tossing of the sea.

People will faint from terror, apprehensive of what is coming on the world, for the heavenly bodies will be shaken.

At that time they will see the Son of Man coming in a cloud with power and great glory.

When these things begin to take place, stand up and lift up your heads, because your redemption is drawing near."

He told them this parable: "Look at the fig tree and all the trees.

When they sprout leaves, you can see for yourselves and know that summer is near.

Even so, when you see these things happening, you know that the kingdom of God is near.

Truly I tell you, this generation will certainly not pass away until all these things have happened.

Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will never pass away.

Be careful, or your hearts will be weighed down with carousing, drunkenness, and the anxieties of life, and that day will close on you suddenly like a trap.

For it will come on all those who live on the face of the whole earth.

Be always on the watch, and pray that you may be able to escape all that is about to happen, and that you may be able to stand before the Son of Man."

Each day Jesus was teaching at the temple, and each evening he went out to spend the night on the hill called the Mount of Olives, and all the people came early in the morning to hear him at the temple.

## Luke 22

The festival of Unleavened Bread, called Passover, was approaching.

The chief priests and scribes were looking for a way to kill Jesus, but they were afraid of the people.

Then Satan entered Judas Iscariot, one of the twelve disciples.

Judas went to the chief priests and officers to discuss how he could betray Jesus to them.

They were glad and agreed to give him money.

Judas accepted and looked for an opportunity to betray Jesus when there was no crowd around.

The day of Unleavened Bread came, when the Passover lamb had to be sacrificed.

Jesus sent Peter and John, saying, "Go and prepare the Passover meal for us to eat."

They asked, "Where do you want us to prepare it?"

Jesus replied, "When you enter the city, a man carrying a jar of water will meet you.

Follow him to the house he enters and say to the owner, 'The Teacher asks, where is the guest room where I can eat the Passover with my disciples?'

He will show you a large, furnished room upstairs.

Prepare the meal there."

They went and found everything as Jesus had told them and prepared the Passover.

When the time came, Jesus sat down with the apostles and said, "I have eagerly desired to eat this Passover with you before I suffer.

I tell you, I will not eat it again until it is fulfilled in the kingdom of God."

He took a cup, gave thanks, and said, "Take this and share it among yourselves.

I tell you, I will not drink from the fruit of the vine until the kingdom of God comes."

He took bread, gave thanks, broke it, and gave it to them, saying, "This is my body given for you; do this in remembrance of me."

In the same way, after the meal, he took the cup, saying, "This cup is the new covenant in my blood, poured out for you.

But look, the hand of the one who betrays me is with mine on the table.

The Son of Man will go as it has been decreed, but woe to that man who betrays him."

They began to question among themselves which of them might do this.

A dispute also arose among them about who was considered to be the greatest.

Jesus said to them, "The kings of the Gentiles lord it over them, and those who exercise authority over them call themselves Benefactors.

But you are not to be like that.

Instead, the greatest among you should be like the youngest, and the one who rules like the one who serves.

For who is greater, the one who is at the table or the one who serves?

Is it not the one who is at the table?

But I am among you as one who serves.

You are those who have stood by me in my trials.

And I confer on you a kingdom, just as my Father conferred one on me, so that you may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom and sit on thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.

Simon, Simon, Satan has asked to sift all of you as wheat.

But I have prayed for you, Simon, that your faith may not fail.

And when you have turned back, strengthen your brothers."

But Peter replied, "Lord, I am ready to go with you to prison and to death."

Jesus answered, "I tell you, Peter, before the rooster crows today, you will deny three times that you know me."

Then Jesus asked them, "When I sent you without purse, bag, or sandals, did you lack anything?"

"Nothing," they answered.

He said to them, "But now if you have a purse, take it, and also a bag; and if you don't have a sword, sell your cloak and buy one.

It is written: 'And he was numbered with the transgressors'; and I tell you that this must be fulfilled in me.

Yes, what is written about me is reaching its fulfillment."

The disciples said, "See, Lord, here are two swords."

"That's enough!" he replied.

Jesus went out as usual to the Mount of Olives, and his disciples followed him.

On reaching the place, he said to them, "Pray that you will not fall into temptation."

He withdrew about a stone's throw beyond them, knelt down, and prayed, "Father, if you are willing, take this cup from me; yet not my will, but yours be done."

When he rose from prayer and went back to the disciples, he found them asleep, exhausted from sorrow.

"Why are you sleeping?" he asked them.

"Get up and pray so that you will not fall into temptation."

While he was still speaking, a crowd came up, and Judas, one of the Twelve, was leading them.

He approached Jesus to kiss him, but Jesus asked him, "Judas, are you betraying the Son of Man with a kiss?"

When Jesus' followers saw what was going to happen, they said, "Lord, should we strike with our swords?"

And one of them struck the servant of the high priest, cutting off his right ear.

But Jesus answered, "No more of this!"

And he touched the man's ear and healed him.

Then Jesus said to the chief priests, the officers of the temple guard, and the elders, who had come for him, "Am I leading a rebellion, that you have come with swords and clubs?

Every day I was with you in the temple courts, and you did not lay a hand on me.

But this is your hour--when darkness reigns."

Then they seized him and led him away, bringing him into the high priest's house.

Peter followed at a distance.

When they had kindled a fire in the middle of the courtyard and sat down together, Peter sat down with them.

A servant girl saw him seated there in the firelight.

She looked closely at him and said, "This man was with him."

But he denied it.

"Woman, I don't know him," he said.

A little later someone else saw him and said, "You also are one of them."

"Man, I am not!" Peter replied.

About an hour later another asserted, "Certainly this fellow was with him, for he is a Galilean."

Peter replied, "Man, I don't know what you're talking about!"

Just as he was speaking, the rooster crowed.

The Lord turned and looked straight at Peter.

Then Peter remembered the word the Lord had spoken to him: "Before the rooster crows today, you will disown me three times."

And he went outside and wept bitterly.

The men who were guarding Jesus began mocking and beating him.

They blindfolded him and demanded, "Prophesy! Who hit you?"

And they said many other insulting things to him.

At daybreak, the council of the elders of the people, both the chief priests and the teachers of the law, met together, and Jesus was led before them.

"If you are the Messiah," they said, "tell us."

Jesus answered, "If I tell you, you will not believe me, and if I asked you, you would not answer.

But from now on, the Son of Man will be seated at the right hand of the mighty God."

They all asked, "Are you then the Son of God?"

He replied, "You say that I am."

Then they said, "Why do we need any more testimony?

We have heard it from his own lips."

## Luke 23

The whole crowd got up and took him to Pilate.

They started accusing him, saying, "We found this man misleading our nation, stopping people from paying taxes to Caesar, and claiming to be Christ, a king."

Pilate asked him, "Are you the king of the Jews?"

Jesus replied, "You say so."

Pilate then told the chief priests and the crowd, "I find no fault in this man."

But they insisted, saying, "He stirs up the people, teaching all over Judea, starting from Galilee to here."

When Pilate heard this, he asked if the man was a Galilean.

Finding out he was under Herod's jurisdiction, he sent him to Herod, who was also in Jerusalem at that time.

Herod was very happy to see Jesus because he had wanted to see him for a long time, having heard about him and hoping to see him perform a miracle.

Herod questioned him at length, but Jesus gave no answer.

The chief priests and scribes stood by, accusing him strongly.

Herod, along with his soldiers, mocked Jesus, dressed him in a splendid robe, and sent him back to Pilate.

That day, Herod and Pilate became friends, though they had been enemies before.

Pilate called together the chief priests, the rulers, and the people, and said, "You brought this man to me as one who incites the people to rebellion.

I have examined him in your presence and found no basis for your charges against him.

Neither has Herod, for he sent him back to us.

As you can see, he has done nothing deserving death.

Therefore, I will punish him and release him."

But the whole crowd shouted, "Away with this man! Release Barabbas to us!"

Barabbas had been thrown into prison for an uprising in the city and for murder.

Wanting to release Jesus, Pilate appealed to them again, but they kept shouting, "Crucify him! Crucify him!"

For the third time, he spoke to them, "Why? What crime has this man committed?

I have found in him no grounds for the death penalty.

Therefore, I will punish him and release him."

But they kept shouting loudly, demanding that he be crucified, and their voices prevailed.

So Pilate decided to grant their demand.

He released the man who had been thrown into prison for insurrection and murder, the one they asked for, and surrendered Jesus to their will.

As they led him away, they seized Simon from Cyrene, who was on his way in from the country, and put the cross on him to carry behind Jesus.

A large number of people followed him, including women who mourned and wailed for him.

Jesus turned and said to them, "Daughters of Jerusalem, do not weep for me; weep for yourselves and for your children.

For the time will come when you will say, 'Blessed are the childless women, the wombs that never bore and the breasts that never nursed!'

Then they will say to the mountains, 'Fall on us!' and to the hills, 'Cover us!'

For if people do these things when the tree is green, what will happen when it is dry?"

Two other men, both criminals, were also led out with him to be executed.

When they came to the place called the Skull, they crucified him there, along with the criminals--one on his right, the other on his left.

They divided up his clothes by casting lots.

The people stood watching, and the rulers even sneered at him.

They said, "He saved others; let him save himself if he is God's Messiah, the Chosen One."

The soldiers also came up and mocked him.

They offered him wine vinegar and said, "If you are the king of the Jews, save yourself."

There was a written notice above him, which read: THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS.

One of the criminals who hung there hurled insults at him: "Aren't you the Messiah? Save yourself and us!"

But the other criminal rebuked him.

"Don't you fear God," he said, "since you are under the same sentence?

We are punished justly, for we are getting what our deeds deserve.

But this man has done nothing wrong."

Then he said, "Jesus, remember me when you come into your kingdom."

Jesus answered him, "Truly I tell you, today you will be with me in paradise."

It was now about noon, and darkness came over the whole land until three in the afternoon, for the sun stopped shining.

And the curtain of the temple was torn in two.

Jesus called out with a loud voice, "Father, into your hands I commit my spirit."

When he had said this, he breathed his last.

The centurion, seeing what had happened, praised God and said, "Surely this was a righteous man."

When all the people who had gathered to witness this sight saw what took place, they beat their breasts and went away.

But all those who knew him, including the women who had followed him from Galilee, stood at a distance, watching these things.

Now there was a man named Joseph, a member of the Council, a good and upright man, who had not consented to their decision and action.

He came from the Judean town of Arimathea and he was waiting for the kingdom of God.

Going to Pilate, he asked for Jesus' body.

Then he took it down, wrapped it in linen cloth, and placed it in a tomb cut in the rock, one in which no one had yet been laid.

It was Preparation Day, and the Sabbath was about to begin.

The women who had come with Jesus from Galilee followed Joseph and saw the tomb and how his body was laid in it.

Then they went home and prepared spices and perfumes.

But they rested on the Sabbath in obedience to the commandment.

## Luke 24

On the first day of the week, very early in the morning, some women went to the tomb, bringing the spices they had prepared.

They found the stone rolled away from the tomb, but when they entered, they did not find the body of the Lord Jesus.

While they were wondering about this, suddenly two men in clothes that gleamed like lightning stood beside them.

In their fright, the women bowed down with their faces to the ground, but the men said to them, "Why do you look for the living among the dead?

He is not here; he has risen!

Remember how he told you, while he was still with you in Galilee: 'The Son of Man must be delivered over to the hands of sinners, be crucified and on the third day be raised again.'"

Then they remembered his words.

When they came back from the tomb, they told all these things to the Eleven and to all the others.

It was Mary Magdalene, Joanna, Mary the mother of James, and the others with them who told this to the apostles.

But they did not believe the women, because their words seemed to them like nonsense.

Peter, however, got up and ran to the tomb.

Bending over, he saw the strips of linen lying by themselves, and he went away, wondering to himself what had happened.

Now that same day two of them were going to a village called Emmaus, about seven miles from Jerusalem.

They were talking with each other about everything that had happened.

As they talked and discussed these things with each other, Jesus himself came up and walked along with them; but they were kept from recognizing him.

He asked them, "What are you discussing together as you walk along?"

They stood still, their faces downcast.

One of them, named Cleopas, asked him, "Are you the only one visiting Jerusalem who does not know the things that have happened there in these days?"

"What things?" he asked.

"About Jesus of Nazareth," they replied.

"He was a prophet, powerful in word and deed before God and all the people.

The chief priests and our rulers handed him over to be sentenced to death, and they crucified him; but we had hoped that he was the one who was going to redeem Israel.

And what is more, it is the third day since all this took place.

In addition, some of our women amazed us.

They went to the tomb early this morning but didn't find his body.

They came and told us that they had seen a vision of angels, who said he was alive.

Then some of our companions went to the tomb and found it just as the women had said, but they did not see Jesus."

He said to them, "How foolish you are, and how slow to believe all that the prophets have spoken!

Did not the Messiah have to suffer these things and then enter his glory?"

And beginning with Moses and all the Prophets, he explained to them what was said in all the Scriptures concerning himself.

As they approached the village to which they were going, Jesus continued on as if he were going farther.

But they urged him strongly, "Stay with us, for it is nearly evening; the day is almost over."

So he went in to stay with them.

When he was at the table with them, he took bread, gave thanks, broke it and began to give it to them.

Then their eyes were opened and they recognized him, and he disappeared from their sight.

They asked each other, "Were not our hearts burning within us while he talked with us on the road and opened the Scriptures to us?"

They got up and returned at once to Jerusalem.

There they found the Eleven and those with them, assembled together and saying, "It is true!

The Lord has risen and has appeared to Simon."

Then the two told what had happened on the way, and how Jesus was recognized by them when he broke the bread.

While they were still talking about this, Jesus himself stood among them and said to them, "Peace be with you."

They were startled and frightened, thinking they saw a ghost.

He said to them, "Why are you troubled, and why do doubts rise in your minds?

Look at my hands and my feet.

It is I myself!

Touch me and see; a ghost does not have flesh and bones, as you see I have."

When he had said this, he showed them his hands and feet.

And while they still did not believe it because of joy and amazement, he asked them, "Do you have anything here to eat?"

They gave him a piece of broiled fish, and he took it and ate it in their presence.

He said to them, "This is what I told you while I was still with you: Everything must be fulfilled that is written about me in the Law of Moses, the Prophets and the Psalms."

Then he opened their minds so they could understand the Scriptures.

He told them, "This is what is written: The Messiah will suffer and rise from the dead on the third day, and repentance for the forgiveness of sins will be preached in his name to all nations, beginning at Jerusalem.

You are witnesses of these things.

I am going to send you what my Father has promised; but stay in the city until you have been clothed with power from on high."

When he had led them out to the vicinity of Bethany, he lifted up his hands and blessed them.

While he was blessing them, he left them and was taken up into heaven.

Then they worshiped him and returned to Jerusalem with great joy.

And they stayed continually at the temple, praising God.

## Mark 1

The beginning of the good news about Jesus Christ, the Son of God, as it is written in the prophet Isaiah: "Look, I am sending my messenger ahead of you, who will prepare your way.

A voice of one calling in the wilderness, 'Prepare the way for the Lord, make straight paths for him.'"

John the Baptist appeared in the wilderness, preaching a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins.

People from all over Judea and Jerusalem went out to him, confessing their sins, and were baptized by him in the Jordan River.

John wore clothes made of camel's hair, with a leather belt around his waist, and he ate locusts and wild honey.

He preached, saying, "After me comes someone more powerful than I, whose sandals I am not worthy to untie.

I baptize you with water, but he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit."

At that time, Jesus came from Nazareth in Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan.

As Jesus was coming up out of the water, he saw heaven being torn open and the Spirit descending on him like a dove.

A voice came from heaven: "You are my Son, whom I love; with you I am well pleased."

Immediately, the Spirit sent him out into the wilderness, and he was in the wilderness for forty days, being tempted by Satan.

He was with the wild animals, and angels attended him.

After John was put in prison, Jesus went into Galilee, proclaiming the good news of God.

"The time has come," he said.

"The kingdom of God has come near.

Repent and believe the good news!"

As Jesus walked beside the Sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and his brother Andrew casting a net into the lake, for they were fishermen.

"Come, follow me," Jesus said, "and I will send you out to fish for people."

At once they left their nets and followed him.

When he had gone a little farther, he saw James son of Zebedee and his brother John in a boat, preparing their nets.

Without delay, he called them, and they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired men and followed him.

They went to Capernaum, and when the Sabbath came, Jesus went into the synagogue and began to teach.

The people were amazed at his teaching, because he taught them as one who had authority, not as the teachers of the law.

Just then a man in their synagogue who was possessed by an impure spirit cried out, "What do you want with us, Jesus of Nazareth?

Have you come to destroy us?

I know who you are--the Holy One of God!"

"Be quiet!" said Jesus sternly.

"Come out of him!"

The impure spirit shook the man violently and came out of him with a shriek.

The people were all so amazed that they asked each other, "What is this?

A new teaching--and with authority!

He even gives orders to impure spirits and they obey him."

News about him spread quickly over the whole region of Galilee.

As soon as they left the synagogue, they went with James and John to the home of Simon and Andrew.

Simon's mother-in-law was in bed with a fever, and they immediately told Jesus about her.

So he went to her, took her hand and helped her up.

The fever left her and she began to wait on them.

That evening after sunset, the people brought to Jesus all the sick and demon-possessed.

The whole town gathered at the door, and Jesus healed many who had various diseases.

He also drove out many demons, but he would not let the demons speak because they knew who he was.

Very early in the morning, while it was still dark, Jesus got up, left the house and went off to a solitary place, where he prayed.

Simon and his companions went to look for him, and when they found him, they exclaimed: "Everyone is looking for you!"

Jesus replied, "Let us go somewhere else--to the nearby villages--so I can preach there also.

That is why I have come."

So he traveled throughout Galilee, preaching in their synagogues and driving out demons.

A man with leprosy came to him and begged him on his knees, "If you are willing, you can make me clean."

Jesus was indignant.

He reached out his hand and touched the man.

"I am willing," he said.

"Be clean!"

Immediately the leprosy left him and he was cleansed.

Jesus sent him away at once with a strong warning: "See that you don't tell this to anyone.

But go, show yourself to the priest and offer the sacrifices that Moses commanded for your cleansing, as a testimony to them."

Instead he went out and began to talk freely, spreading the news.

As a result, Jesus could no longer enter a town openly but stayed outside in lonely places.

Yet the people still came to him from everywhere.

## Mark 2

Jesus went back to Capernaum, and people heard he was at home.

So many gathered that there was no room left, not even outside the door.

He was speaking to them, and some people came bringing a paralyzed man carried by four others.

They couldn't get him to Jesus because of the crowd, so they made an opening in the roof above Jesus and lowered the man on his mat.

Seeing their faith, Jesus said to the paralyzed man, "Son, your sins are forgiven."

Some teachers of the law were sitting there, thinking to themselves, "Why does this fellow talk like that? He's blaspheming! Who can forgive sins but God alone?"

Immediately, Jesus knew in his spirit that this was what they were thinking, and he said to them, "Why are you thinking these things?

Which is easier: to say to this paralyzed man, 'Your sins are forgiven,' or to say, 'Get up, take your mat and walk'?

But I want you to know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins."

So he said to the man, "I tell you, get up, take your mat and go home."

He got up, took his mat, and walked out in full view of them all.

This amazed everyone, and they praised God, saying, "We have never seen anything like this!"

Jesus went out beside the lake again, and a large crowd came to him, and he taught them.

As he walked along, he saw Levi, son of Alphaeus, sitting at the tax collector's booth.

"Follow me," Jesus told him, and Levi got up and followed him.

While Jesus was having dinner at Levi's house, many tax collectors and sinners were eating with him and his disciples, for there were many who followed him.

When the teachers of the law who were Pharisees saw him eating with the sinners and tax collectors, they asked his disciples, "Why does he eat with tax collectors and sinners?"

On hearing this, Jesus said to them, "It is not the healthy who need a doctor, but the sick.

I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners."

Now John's disciples and the Pharisees were fasting.

Some people came and asked Jesus, "How is it that John's disciples and the disciples of the Pharisees are fasting, but yours are not?"

Jesus answered, "How can the guests of the bridegroom fast while he is with them?

They cannot, so long as they have him with them.

But the time will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them, and on that day they will fast."

"No one sews a patch of unshrunk cloth on an old garment.

Otherwise, the new piece will pull away from the old, making the tear worse.

And no one pours new wine into old wineskins.

Otherwise, the wine will burst the skins, and both the wine and the wineskins will be ruined.

No, they pour new wine into new wineskins."

One Sabbath, Jesus was going through the grainfields, and his disciples began to pick some heads of grain.

The Pharisees said to him, "Look, why are they doing what is unlawful on the Sabbath?"

He answered, "Have you never read what David did when he and his companions were hungry and in need?

In the days of Abiathar the high priest, he entered the house of God and ate the consecrated bread, which is lawful only for priests to eat.

And he also gave some to his companions."

Then he said to them, "The Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath.

So the Son of Man is Lord even of the Sabbath."

## Mark 3

Jesus went into a synagogue again, and there was a man with a withered hand.

People were watching to see if Jesus would heal him on the Sabbath so they could accuse him.

Jesus told the man to stand in the middle and asked the people if it was right to do good or harm on the Sabbath, to save a life or to kill.

They stayed silent.

Jesus was angry and sad about their stubborn hearts.

He told the man to stretch out his hand, and when he did, it was healed.

The Pharisees left and started plotting with the Herodians on how to kill Jesus.

Jesus and his disciples went to the sea, and a large crowd from Galilee, Judea, Jerusalem, Idumea, beyond the Jordan, and around Tyre and Sidon followed him because they heard about what he was doing.

Jesus told his disciples to have a small boat ready for him because of the crowd, so they wouldn't crush him.

He healed many people, and those with diseases were trying to touch him.

Whenever unclean spirits saw him, they fell down and shouted, "You are the Son of God!"

But Jesus ordered them not to make him known.

Jesus went up a mountain and called those he wanted, and they came to him.

He appointed twelve apostles to be with him and to send them out to preach and have authority to drive out demons.

He named Simon "Peter," James and John "Sons of Thunder," and included Andrew, Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew, Thomas, James son of Alphaeus, Thaddaeus, Simon the Zealot, and Judas Iscariot, who later betrayed him.

Jesus went into a house, and a crowd gathered again, making it hard for them to eat.

When his family heard about it, they went to take charge of him, saying he was out of his mind.

Teachers of the law from Jerusalem said he was possessed by Beelzebul and that he drove out demons by the prince of demons.

Jesus called them and spoke in parables, asking how Satan could drive out Satan.

He said a kingdom or house divided against itself cannot stand.

He explained that no one can enter a strong man's house and steal his possessions unless he first ties up the strong man.

Jesus said all sins and blasphemies will be forgiven, but whoever blasphemes against the Holy Spirit will never be forgiven and is guilty of an eternal sin.

This was because they said he had an unclean spirit.

Jesus' mother and brothers arrived and stood outside, sending someone to call him.

A crowd was sitting around him, and they told him, "Your mother and brothers are outside looking for you."

Jesus replied, "Who are my mother and brothers?"

He looked at those sitting around him and said, "Here are my mother and brothers!

Whoever does God's will is my brother, sister, and mother."

## Mark 4

Once again, he began teaching by the sea, and a large crowd gathered around him.

He got into a boat and sat in it on the sea, while the whole crowd was on the land by the sea.

He taught them many things in parables and said to them in his teaching, "Listen! A sower went out to sow.

As he sowed, some seed fell along the path, and the birds came and ate it up.

Other seed fell on rocky ground, where it didn't have much soil, and it sprang up quickly because the soil was shallow.

But when the sun came up, the plants were scorched, and they withered because they had no root.

Other seed fell among thorns, which grew up and choked the plants, so they did not bear grain.

Still other seed fell on good soil.

It came up, grew, and produced a crop, multiplying thirty, sixty, or even a hundred times."

Then he said, "Whoever has ears to hear, let them hear."

When he was alone, the Twelve and the others around him asked him about the parables.

He told them, "The secret of the kingdom of God has been given to you.

But to those on the outside, everything is said in parables so that, 'they may be ever seeing but never perceiving, and ever hearing but never understanding; otherwise they might turn and be forgiven!'"

Then Jesus said to them, "Don't you understand this parable?

How then will you understand any parable?

The farmer sows the word.

Some people are like seed along the path, where the word is sown.

As soon as they hear it, Satan comes and takes away the word that was sown in them.

Others, like seed sown on rocky places, hear the word and at once receive it with joy.

But since they have no root, they last only a short time.

When trouble or persecution comes because of the word, they quickly fall away.

Still others, like seed sown among thorns, hear the word; but the worries of this life, the deceitfulness of wealth, and the desires for other things come in and choke the word, making it unfruitful.

Others, like seed sown on good soil, hear the word, accept it, and produce a crop--thirty, sixty, or even a hundred times what was sown."

He also said to them, "Do you bring in a lamp to put it under a bowl or a bed?

Instead, don't you put it on its stand?

For whatever is hidden is meant to be disclosed, and whatever is concealed is meant to be brought out into the open.

If anyone has ears to hear, let them hear."

"Consider carefully what you hear," he continued.

"With the measure you use, it will be measured to you--and even more.

Whoever has will be given more; whoever does not have, even what they have will be taken from them."

He also said, "This is what the kingdom of God is like.

A man scatters seed on the ground.

Night and day, whether he sleeps or gets up, the seed sprouts and grows, though he does not know how.

All by itself the soil produces grain--first the stalk, then the head, then the full kernel in the head.

As soon as the grain is ripe, he puts the sickle to it, because the harvest has come."

Again he said, "What shall we say the kingdom of God is like, or what parable shall we use to describe it?

It is like a mustard seed, which is the smallest of all seeds on earth.

Yet when planted, it grows and becomes the largest of all garden plants, with such big branches that the birds can perch in its shade."

With many similar parables, Jesus spoke the word to them, as much as they could understand.

He did not say anything to them without using a parable.

But when he was alone with his own disciples, he explained everything.

That day when evening came, he said to his disciples, "Let us go over to the other side."

Leaving the crowd behind, they took him along, just as he was, in the boat.

There were also other boats with him.

A furious squall came up, and the waves broke over the boat, so that it was nearly swamped.

Jesus was in the stern, sleeping on a cushion.

The disciples woke him and said to him, "Teacher, don't you care if we drown?"

He got up, rebuked the wind, and said to the waves, "Quiet! Be still!"

Then the wind died down, and it was completely calm.

He said to his disciples, "Why are you so afraid?

Do you still have no faith?"

They were terrified and asked each other, "Who is this?

Even the wind and the waves obey him!"

## Mark 5

They arrived on the other side of the sea, in the region of the Gerasenes.

As soon as Jesus got out of the boat, a man with an unclean spirit came from the tombs to meet him.

This man lived in the tombs, and no one could bind him anymore, not even with a chain.

He had often been chained hand and foot, but he tore the chains apart and broke the irons on his feet.

No one was strong enough to subdue him.

Night and day among the tombs and in the hills he would cry out and cut himself with stones.

When he saw Jesus from a distance, he ran and fell on his knees in front of him.

He shouted at the top of his voice, "What do you want with me, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? In God's name don't torture me!"

For Jesus had said to him, "Come out of this man, you impure spirit!"

Then Jesus asked him, "What is your name?"

"My name is Legion," he replied, "for we are many."

And he begged Jesus again and again not to send them out of the area.

A large herd of pigs was feeding on the nearby hillside.

The demons begged Jesus, "Send us among the pigs; allow us to go into them."

He gave them permission, and the impure spirits came out and went into the pigs.

The herd, about two thousand in number, rushed down the steep bank into the lake and were drowned.

Those tending the pigs ran off and reported this in the town and countryside, and the people went out to see what had happened.

When they came to Jesus, they saw the man who had been possessed by the legion of demons, sitting there, dressed and in his right mind; and they were afraid.

Those who had seen it told the people what had happened to the demon-possessed man--and told about the pigs as well.

Then the people began to plead with Jesus to leave their region.

As Jesus was getting into the boat, the man who had been demon-possessed begged to go with him.

Jesus did not let him, but said, "Go home to your own people and tell them how much the Lord has done for you, and how he has had mercy on you."

So the man went away and began to tell in the Decapolis how much Jesus had done for him.

And all the people were amazed.

When Jesus had again crossed over by boat to the other side of the lake, a large crowd gathered around him while he was by the lake.

Then one of the synagogue leaders, named Jairus, came, and when he saw Jesus, he fell at his feet.

He pleaded earnestly with him, "My little daughter is dying. Please come and put your hands on her so that she will be healed and live."

So Jesus went with him.

A large crowd followed and pressed around him.

And a woman was there who had been subject to bleeding for twelve years.

She had suffered a great deal under the care of many doctors and had spent all she had, yet instead of getting better she grew worse.

When she heard about Jesus, she came up behind him in the crowd and touched his cloak, because she thought, "If I just touch his clothes, I will be healed."

Immediately her bleeding stopped and she felt in her body that she was freed from her suffering.

At once Jesus realized that power had gone out from him.

He turned around in the crowd and asked, "Who touched my clothes?"

"You see the people crowding against you," his disciples answered, "and yet you can ask, 'Who touched me?'"

But Jesus kept looking around to see who had done it.

Then the woman, knowing what had happened to her, came and fell at his feet and, trembling with fear, told him the whole truth.

He said to her, "Daughter, your faith has healed you. Go in peace and be freed from your suffering."

While Jesus was still speaking, some people came from the house of Jairus, the synagogue leader.

"Your daughter is dead," they said. "Why bother the teacher anymore?"

Overhearing what they said, Jesus told him, "Don't be afraid; just believe."

He did not let anyone follow him except Peter, James, and John the brother of James.

When they came to the home of the synagogue leader, Jesus saw a commotion, with people crying and wailing loudly.

He went in and said to them, "Why all this commotion and wailing? The child is not dead but asleep."

But they laughed at him.

After he put them all out, he took the child's father and mother and the disciples who were with him, and went in where the child was.

He took her by the hand and said to her, "Talitha koum!" (which means "Little girl, I say to you, get up!").

Immediately the girl stood up and began to walk around (she was twelve years old).

At this they were completely astonished.

He gave strict orders not to let anyone know about this, and told them to give her something to eat.

## Mark 6

Jesus left there and went to his hometown, and his disciples followed him.

On the Sabbath, he began teaching in the synagogue, and many who heard him were amazed.

They asked, "Where did he get these things? What is this wisdom that has been given to him, and what are these remarkable miracles he is performing?

Isn't this the carpenter, the son of Mary, and the brother of James, Joseph, Judas, and Simon?

Aren't his sisters here with us?"

And they took offense at him.

Jesus said to them, "A prophet is not without honor except in his own town, among his relatives, and in his own home."

He could not do any miracles there, except lay his hands on a few sick people and heal them.

He was amazed at their lack of faith.

Then Jesus went around teaching from village to village.

Calling the Twelve to him, he began to send them out two by two and gave them authority over impure spirits.

He instructed them to take nothing for the journey except a staff--no bread, no bag, no money in their belts.

Wear sandals but not an extra shirt.

"Whenever you enter a house, stay there until you leave that town.

And if any place will not welcome you or listen to you, leave that place and shake the dust off your feet as a testimony against them."

They went out and preached that people should repent.

They drove out many demons and anointed many sick people with oil and healed them.

King Herod heard about this, for Jesus' name had become well known.

Some were saying, "John the Baptist has been raised from the dead, and that is why miraculous powers are at work in him."

Others said, "He is Elijah."

And still others claimed, "He is a prophet, like one of the prophets of long ago."

But when Herod heard this, he said, "John, whom I beheaded, has been raised from the dead!"

For Herod himself had given orders to have John arrested, and he had him bound and put in prison.

He did this because of Herodias, his brother Philip's wife, whom he had married.

For John had been saying to Herod, "It is not lawful for you to have your brother's wife."

So Herodias nursed a grudge against John and wanted to kill him.

But she was not able to, because Herod feared John and protected him, knowing him to be a righteous and holy man.

When Herod heard John, he was greatly puzzled, yet he liked to listen to him.

Finally, the opportune time came.

On his birthday, Herod gave a banquet for his high officials and military commanders and the leading men of Galilee.

When the daughter of Herodias came in and danced, she pleased Herod and his dinner guests.

The king said to the girl, "Ask me for anything you want, and I'll give it to you."

And he promised her with an oath, "Whatever you ask I will give you, up to half my kingdom."

She went out and said to her mother, "What shall I ask for?"

"The head of John the Baptist," she answered.

At once the girl hurried in to the king with the request: "I want you to give me right now the head of John the Baptist on a platter."

The king was greatly distressed, but because of his oaths and his dinner guests, he did not want to refuse her.

So he immediately sent an executioner with orders to bring John's head.

The man went, beheaded John in the prison, and brought back his head on a platter.

He presented it to the girl, and she gave it to her mother.

On hearing of this, John's disciples came and took his body and laid it in a tomb.

The apostles gathered around Jesus and reported to him all they had done and taught.

Then, because so many people were coming and going that they did not even have a chance to eat, he said to them, "Come with me by yourselves to a quiet place and get some rest."

So they went away by themselves in a boat to a solitary place.

But many who saw them leaving recognized them and ran on foot from all the towns and got there ahead of them.

When Jesus landed and saw a large crowd, he had compassion on them, because they were like sheep without a shepherd.

So he began teaching them many things.

By this time it was late in the day, so his disciples came to him.

"This is a remote place," they said, "and it's already very late.

Send the people away so that they can go to the surrounding countryside and villages and buy themselves something to eat."

But he answered, "You give them something to eat."

They said to him, "That would take more than half a year's wages! Are we to go and spend that much on bread and give it to them to eat?"

"How many loaves do you have?" he asked.

"Go and see."

When they found out, they said, "Five--and two fish."

Then Jesus directed them to have all the people sit down in groups on the green grass.

So they sat down in groups of hundreds and fifties.

Taking the five loaves and the two fish and looking up to heaven, he gave thanks and broke the loaves.

Then he gave them to his disciples to distribute to the people.

He also divided the two fish among them all.

They all ate and were satisfied, and the disciples picked up twelve basketfuls of broken pieces of bread and fish.

The number of the men who had eaten was five thousand.

Immediately Jesus made his disciples get into the boat and go on ahead of him to Bethsaida, while he dismissed the crowd.

After leaving them, he went up on a mountainside to pray.

Later that night, the boat was in the middle of the lake, and he was alone on land.

He saw the disciples straining at the oars, because the wind was against them.

Shortly before dawn he went out to them, walking on the lake.

He was about to pass by them, but when they saw him walking on the lake, they thought he was a ghost.

They cried out, because they all saw him and were terrified.

Immediately he spoke to them and said, "Take courage! It is I. Don't be afraid."

Then he climbed into the boat with them, and the wind died down.

They were completely amazed, for they had not understood about the loaves; their hearts were hardened.

When they had crossed over, they landed at Gennesaret and anchored there.

As soon as they got out of the boat, people recognized Jesus.

They ran throughout that whole region and carried the sick on mats to wherever they heard he was.

And wherever he went--into villages, towns, or countryside--they placed the sick in the marketplaces.

They begged him to let them touch even the edge of his cloak, and all who touched it were healed.

## Mark 7

The Pharisees and some teachers of the law came from Jerusalem and gathered around Jesus.

They noticed that some of his disciples were eating with unwashed hands, which was against the tradition of the elders.

The Pharisees and all the Jews do not eat unless they wash their hands properly, following the tradition of the elders.

They also do not eat after coming from the market unless they wash, and they follow many other traditions like washing cups, pitchers, and kettles.

The Pharisees and teachers of the law asked Jesus, "Why don't your disciples follow the tradition of the elders and eat with unwashed hands?"

Jesus replied, "Isaiah was right when he prophesied about you hypocrites; as it is written: 'These people honor me with their lips, but their hearts are far from me.

They worship me in vain; their teachings are merely human rules.'

You have let go of the commands of God and are holding on to human traditions."

Jesus continued, "You have a fine way of setting aside the commands of God to observe your own traditions!

For Moses said, 'Honor your father and mother,' and, 'Anyone who curses their father or mother is to be put to death.'

But you say that if anyone declares that what might have been used to help their father or mother is 'Corban' (that is, devoted to God), then you no longer let them do anything for their father or mother.

Thus you nullify the word of God by your tradition that you have handed down.

And you do many things like that."

Again Jesus called the crowd to him and said, "Listen to me, everyone, and understand this.

Nothing outside a person can defile them by going into them.

Rather, it is what comes out of a person that defiles them."

After he had left the crowd and entered the house, his disciples asked him about this parable.

"Are you so dull?" he asked.

"Don't you see that nothing that enters a person from the outside can defile them?

For it doesn't go into their heart but into their stomach, and then out of the body."

(In saying this, Jesus declared all foods clean.)

He went on: "What comes out of a person is what defiles them.

For it is from within, out of a person's heart, that evil thoughts come--sexual immorality, theft, murder, adultery, greed, malice, deceit, lewdness, envy, slander, arrogance, and folly.

All these evils come from inside and defile a person."

Jesus left that place and went to the vicinity of Tyre.

He entered a house and did not want anyone to know it; yet he could not keep his presence secret.

In fact, as soon as she heard about him, a woman whose little daughter was possessed by an impure spirit came and fell at his feet.

The woman was a Greek, born in Syrian Phoenicia.

She begged Jesus to drive the demon out of her daughter.

"First let the children eat all they want," he told her, "for it is not right to take the children's bread and toss it to the dogs."

"Lord," she replied, "even the dogs under the table eat the children's crumbs."

Then he told her, "For such a reply, you may go; the demon has left your daughter."

She went home and found her child lying on the bed, and the demon gone.

Then Jesus left the vicinity of Tyre and went through Sidon, down to the Sea of Galilee and into the region of the Decapolis.

There some people brought to him a man who was deaf and could hardly talk, and they begged Jesus to place his hand on him.

After he took him aside, away from the crowd, Jesus put his fingers into the man's ears.

Then he spit and touched the man's tongue.

He looked up to heaven and with a deep sigh said to him, "Ephphatha!" (which means "Be opened!").

At this, the man's ears were opened, his tongue was loosened, and he began to speak plainly.

Jesus commanded them not to tell anyone.

But the more he did so, the more they kept talking about it.

People were overwhelmed with amazement.

"He has done everything well," they said.

"He even makes the deaf hear and the mute speak."

## Mark 8

In those days, there was a large crowd again, and they had nothing to eat.

Jesus called his disciples and said to them, "I feel sorry for the crowd because they have been with me for three days and have nothing to eat.

If I send them home hungry, they might faint on the way, and some of them have come from far away."

His disciples answered him, "Where can anyone get enough bread to feed them here in this deserted place?"

Jesus asked them, "How many loaves do you have?"

They said, "Seven."

He told the crowd to sit down on the ground.

Taking the seven loaves, he gave thanks, broke them, and gave them to his disciples to distribute to the people.

They also had a few small fish, and after blessing them, he told the disciples to distribute these as well.

The people ate and were satisfied, and they collected seven baskets of leftover pieces.

About four thousand people were there, and he sent them away.

Immediately, he got into the boat with his disciples and went to the region of Dalmanutha.

The Pharisees came and began to argue with him, asking for a sign from heaven to test him.

Sighing deeply in his spirit, he said, "Why does this generation ask for a sign?

Truly I tell you, no sign will be given to this generation."

Then he left them, got back into the boat, and went to the other side.

The disciples had forgotten to bring bread, except for one loaf they had with them in the boat.

Jesus warned them, "Watch out for the yeast of the Pharisees and that of Herod."

They discussed this with one another and said, "It is because we have no bread."

Aware of their discussion, Jesus asked them, "Why are you talking about having no bread?

Do you still not see or understand?

Are your hearts hardened?

Do you have eyes but fail to see, and ears but fail to hear?

And don't you remember?

When I broke the five loaves for the five thousand, how many basketfuls of pieces did you pick up?"

"Twelve," they replied.

"And when I broke the seven loaves for the four thousand, how many basketfuls of pieces did you pick up?"

They answered, "Seven."

He said to them, "Do you still not understand?"

They came to Bethsaida, and some people brought a blind man to Jesus and begged him to touch him.

He took the blind man by the hand and led him outside the village.

When he had spit on the man's eyes and put his hands on him, Jesus asked, "Do you see anything?"

He looked up and said, "I see people; they look like trees walking around."

Once more Jesus put his hands on the man's eyes.

Then his eyes were opened, his sight was restored, and he saw everything clearly.

Jesus sent him home, saying, "Don't even go into the village."

Jesus and his disciples went on to the villages around Caesarea Philippi.

On the way, he asked them, "Who do people say I am?"

They replied, "Some say John the Baptist; others say Elijah; and still others, one of the prophets."

"But what about you?" he asked.

"Who do you say I am?"

Peter answered, "You are the Messiah."

Jesus warned them not to tell anyone about him.

He then began to teach them that the Son of Man must suffer many things and be rejected by the elders, the chief priests, and the teachers of the law, and that he must be killed and after three days rise again.

He spoke plainly about this, and Peter took him aside and began to rebuke him.

But when Jesus turned and looked at his disciples, he rebuked Peter.

"Get behind me, Satan!" he said.

"You do not have in mind the concerns of God, but merely human concerns."

Then he called the crowd to him along with his disciples and said: "Whoever wants to be my disciple must deny themselves and take up their cross and follow me.

For whoever wants to save their life will lose it, but whoever loses their life for me and for the gospel will save it.

What good is it for someone to gain the whole world, yet forfeit their soul?

Or what can anyone give in exchange for their soul?

If anyone is ashamed of me and my words in this adulterous and sinful generation, the Son of Man will be ashamed of them when he comes in his Father's glory with the holy angels."

## Mark 9

Jesus told them, "Truly, I say to you, some of you standing here will not die before you see the Kingdom of God come with power."

After six days, Jesus took Peter, James, and John up a high mountain by themselves.

There, he changed in front of them, and his clothes became dazzling white, whiter than anyone on earth could bleach them.

Elijah and Moses appeared and talked with Jesus.

Peter said to Jesus, "Teacher, it's good for us to be here.

Let's make three shelters: one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah."

He didn't know what to say because they were so afraid.

Then a cloud covered them, and a voice from the cloud said, "This is my beloved Son.

Listen to him!"

Suddenly, when they looked around, they saw no one except Jesus with them.

As they were coming down the mountain, Jesus told them not to tell anyone what they had seen until the Son of Man had risen from the dead.

They kept this to themselves, wondering what "rising from the dead" meant.

They asked him, "Why do the teachers of the law say that Elijah must come first?"

Jesus replied, "Elijah does come first to restore all things.

But why is it written that the Son of Man must suffer and be rejected?

But I tell you, Elijah has come, and they did to him whatever they wanted, just as it is written about him."

When they came to the other disciples, they saw a large crowd around them and the teachers of the law arguing with them.

As soon as the crowd saw Jesus, they were amazed and ran to greet him.

Jesus asked, "What are you arguing about?"

A man in the crowd answered, "Teacher, I brought my son to you.

He has a spirit that makes him unable to speak.

Whenever it seizes him, it throws him to the ground.

He foams at the mouth, grinds his teeth, and becomes rigid.

I asked your disciples to drive it out, but they couldn't."

Jesus replied, "You unbelieving generation!

How long shall I stay with you?

How long shall I put up with you?

Bring the boy to me."

So they brought him.

When the spirit saw Jesus, it immediately threw the boy into a convulsion.

He fell to the ground and rolled around, foaming at the mouth.

Jesus asked the boy's father, "How long has he been like this?"

"From childhood," he answered.

"It has often thrown him into fire or water to kill him.

But if you can do anything, take pity on us and help us."

"If you can?" said Jesus.

"Everything is possible for one who believes."

Immediately the boy's father exclaimed, "I do believe; help me overcome my unbelief!"

When Jesus saw that a crowd was running to the scene, he rebuked the impure spirit.

"You deaf and mute spirit," he said, "I command you, come out of him and never enter him again."

The spirit shrieked, convulsed him violently, and came out.

The boy looked so much like a corpse that many said, "He's dead."

But Jesus took him by the hand and lifted him to his feet, and he stood up.

After Jesus had gone indoors, his disciples asked him privately, "Why couldn't we drive it out?"

He replied, "This kind can come out only by prayer and fasting."

They left that place and passed through Galilee.

Jesus did not want anyone to know where they were because he was teaching his disciples.

He said to them, "The Son of Man is going to be delivered into the hands of men.

They will kill him, and after three days he will rise."

But they did not understand what he meant and were afraid to ask him about it.

They came to Capernaum.

When he was in the house, he asked them, "What were you arguing about on the road?"

But they kept quiet because on the way they had argued about who was the greatest.

Sitting down, Jesus called the Twelve and said, "Anyone who wants to be first must be the very last, and the servant of all."

He took a little child whom he placed among them.

Taking the child in his arms, he said to them, "Whoever welcomes one of these little children in my name welcomes me; and whoever welcomes me does not welcome me but the one who sent me."

"Teacher," said John, "we saw someone driving out demons in your name and we told him to stop because he was not one of us."

"Do not stop him," Jesus said.

"For no one who does a miracle in my name can in the next moment say anything bad about me, for whoever is not against us is for us.

Truly I tell you, anyone who gives you a cup of water in my name because you belong to the Messiah will certainly not lose their reward."

"If anyone causes one of these little ones--those who believe in me--to stumble, it would be better for them if a large millstone were hung around their neck and they were thrown into the sea.

If your hand causes you to stumble, cut it off.

It is better for you to enter life maimed than with two hands to go into hell, where the fire never goes out.

And if your foot causes you to stumble, cut it off.

It is better for you to enter life crippled than to have two feet and be thrown into hell.

And if your eye causes you to stumble, pluck it out.

It is better for you to enter the kingdom of God with one eye than to have two eyes and be thrown into hell, where the worms that eat them do not die, and the fire is not quenched.

Everyone will be salted with fire.

Salt is good, but if it loses its saltiness, how can you make it salty again?

Have salt among yourselves, and be at peace with each other.

## Mark 10

Jesus traveled to the region of Judea and across the Jordan River.

Crowds gathered around him again, and as usual, he taught them.

Some Pharisees came to test him by asking if it was lawful for a man to divorce his wife.

Jesus asked them what Moses commanded, and they replied that Moses allowed a man to write a certificate of divorce.

Jesus explained that Moses wrote this law because of their hard hearts, but from the beginning of creation, God made them male and female.

Therefore, a man will leave his parents and be united with his wife, and the two will become one flesh.

What God has joined together, let no one separate.

Later, the disciples asked Jesus about this again, and he said that anyone who divorces his wife and marries another woman commits adultery.

The same goes for a woman who divorces her husband and marries another man.

People were bringing children to Jesus for him to bless them, but the disciples scolded them.

Jesus was upset and said, "Let the children come to me, and do not stop them, for the kingdom of God belongs to such as these.

Truly, anyone who does not receive the kingdom of God like a child will never enter it."

He took the children in his arms, placed his hands on them, and blessed them.

As Jesus was leaving, a man ran up to him and asked, "Good teacher, what must I do to inherit eternal life?"

Jesus replied, "Why do you call me good? No one is good except God alone.

You know the commandments: Do not murder, do not commit adultery, do not steal, do not give false testimony, do not defraud, honor your father and mother."

The man said he had kept all these since he was young.

Jesus looked at him with love and said, "You lack one thing: go, sell everything you have and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven.

Then come, follow me."

The man went away sad because he had great wealth.

Jesus looked around and said to his disciples, "How hard it is for the rich to enter the kingdom of God!"

The disciples were amazed at his words.

Jesus said again, "Children, how hard it is to enter the kingdom of God!

It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter the kingdom of God."

The disciples were even more amazed and asked, "Who then can be saved?"

Jesus looked at them and said, "With man this is impossible, but not with God; all things are possible with God."

Peter spoke up, "We have left everything to follow you!"

Jesus replied, "Truly I tell you, no one who has left home or family for me and the gospel will fail to receive a hundred times as much in this present age and in the age to come, eternal life.

But many who are first will be last, and the last first."

As they were on their way to Jerusalem, Jesus was leading the way, and the disciples were astonished, while those who followed were afraid.

He took the twelve aside and told them what was going to happen to him: "We are going up to Jerusalem, and the Son of Man will be delivered to the chief priests and teachers of the law.

They will condemn him to death and hand him over to the Gentiles, who will mock him, spit on him, flog him, and kill him.

Three days later he will rise."

Then James and John, the sons of Zebedee, came to him and asked, "Teacher, we want you to do for us whatever we ask."

Jesus asked what they wanted, and they said, "Let one of us sit at your right and the other at your left in your glory."

Jesus said, "You don't know what you are asking.

Can you drink the cup I drink or be baptized with the baptism I am baptized with?"

They said they could, and Jesus told them they would indeed drink the cup and be baptized with the baptism, but to sit at his right or left was not for him to grant.

When the other ten disciples heard about this, they became indignant with James and John.

Jesus called them together and said, "You know that those who are regarded as rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and their high officials exercise authority over them.

Not so with you.

Instead, whoever wants to become great among you must be your servant, and whoever wants to be first must be the slave of all.

For even the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many."

As they were leaving Jericho, a blind man named Bartimaeus was sitting by the roadside begging.

When he heard that Jesus of Nazareth was passing by, he began to shout, "Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!"

Many rebuked him and told him to be quiet, but he shouted all the more, "Son of David, have mercy on me!"

Jesus stopped and said, "Call him."

So they called to the blind man, "Cheer up! On your feet! He's calling you."

Throwing his cloak aside, he jumped to his feet and came to Jesus.

"What do you want me to do for you?" Jesus asked him.

The blind man said, "Rabbi, I want to see."

Jesus said, "Go, your faith has healed you."

Immediately he received his sight and followed Jesus along the road.

## Mark 11

When they were near Jerusalem, at Bethphage and Bethany by the Mount of Olives, Jesus sent two of his disciples and told them, "Go into the village ahead of you, and as soon as you enter it, you will find a young donkey tied up, which no one has ever ridden.

Untie it and bring it here.

If anyone asks you why you are doing this, say, 'The Lord needs it and will send it back here shortly.'"

So they went and found the young donkey tied outside in the street and untied it.

Some people standing there asked, "What are you doing, untying that donkey?"

They answered as Jesus had told them to, and the people let them go.

They brought the donkey to Jesus, threw their cloaks over it, and he sat on it.

Many people spread their cloaks on the road, while others spread branches they had cut in the fields.

Those who went ahead and those who followed shouted, "Hosanna!

Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord!

Blessed is the coming kingdom of our father David!

Hosanna in the highest heaven!"

Jesus entered Jerusalem and went into the temple courts.

He looked around at everything, but since it was already late, he went out to Bethany with the Twelve.

The next day, as they were leaving Bethany, Jesus was hungry.

Seeing in the distance a fig tree in leaf, he went to find out if it had any fruit.

When he reached it, he found nothing but leaves, because it was not the season for figs.

Then he said to the tree, "May no one ever eat fruit from you again," and his disciples heard him say it.

On reaching Jerusalem, Jesus entered the temple courts and began driving out those who were buying and selling there.

He overturned the tables of the money changers and the benches of those selling doves and would not allow anyone to carry merchandise through the temple courts.

And as he taught them, he said, "Is it not written: 'My house will be called a house of prayer for all nations'?

But you have made it a den of robbers."

The chief priests and the teachers of the law heard this and began looking for a way to kill him, for they feared him, because the whole crowd was amazed at his teaching.

When evening came, Jesus and his disciples went out of the city.

In the morning, as they went along, they saw the fig tree withered from the roots.

Peter remembered and said to Jesus, "Rabbi, look!

The fig tree you cursed has withered!"

"Have faith in God," Jesus answered.

"Truly I tell you, if anyone says to this mountain, 'Go, throw yourself into the sea,' and does not doubt in their heart but believes that what they say will happen, it will be done for them.

Therefore I tell you, whatever you ask for in prayer, believe that you have received it, and it will be yours.

And when you stand praying, if you hold anything against anyone, forgive them, so that your Father in heaven may forgive you your sins."

They arrived again in Jerusalem, and while Jesus was walking in the temple courts, the chief priests, the teachers of the law, and the elders came to him.

"By what authority are you doing these things?" they asked.

"And who gave you authority to do this?"

Jesus replied, "I will ask you one question.

Answer me, and I will tell you by what authority I am doing these things.

John's baptism--was it from heaven, or of human origin?

Tell me!"

They discussed it among themselves and said, "If we say, 'From heaven,' he will ask, 'Then why didn't you believe him?'

But if we say, 'Of human origin'..."

(They feared the people, for everyone held that John really was a prophet.)

So they answered Jesus, "We don't know."

Jesus said, "Neither will I tell you by what authority I am doing these things."

## Mark 12

Jesus began to speak to them in stories.

He said, "A man planted a vineyard, put a fence around it, dug a pit for the winepress, and built a watchtower.

Then he rented it to some farmers and went away.

At harvest time, he sent a servant to collect some of the fruit from the farmers.

But they beat him and sent him away empty-handed.

He sent another servant, and they hit him on the head and treated him shamefully.

He sent another, and they killed him.

He sent many others; some they beat, others they killed.

Finally, he had one left to send, his beloved son.

He sent him last, saying, 'They will respect my son.'

But the farmers said to each other, 'This is the heir.

Let's kill him, and the inheritance will be ours.'

So they took him, killed him, and threw him out of the vineyard.

What will the owner of the vineyard do?

He will come and destroy the farmers and give the vineyard to others.

Haven't you read this scripture: 'The stone the builders rejected has become the cornerstone; the Lord has done this, and it is marvelous in our eyes'?"

The religious leaders wanted to arrest Jesus because they knew he had told this story against them, but they were afraid of the crowd.

So they left him and went away.

Later, they sent some Pharisees and Herodians to trap him with his own words.

They came to him and said, "Teacher, we know you are truthful and don't care about anyone's opinion because you don't look at people's status but teach the way of God truthfully.

Is it right to pay taxes to Caesar or not?

Should we pay or shouldn't we?"

But Jesus knew their hypocrisy and said, "Why are you trying to trap me?

Bring me a coin and let me look at it."

They brought the coin, and he asked them, "Whose image is this, and whose inscription?"

"Caesar's," they replied.

Then Jesus said to them, "Give back to Caesar what is Caesar's and to God what is God's."

And they were amazed at him.

Then the Sadducees, who say there is no resurrection, came to him with a question.

"Teacher," they said, "Moses wrote for us that if a man's brother dies and leaves a wife but no children, the man must marry the widow and raise up offspring for his brother.

There were seven brothers.

The first one married and died without leaving any children.

The second one married the widow, but he also died, leaving no child.

It was the same with the third.

In fact, none of the seven left any children.

Last of all, the woman died too.

At the resurrection, whose wife will she be, since the seven were married to her?"

Jesus replied, "Are you not in error because you do not know the Scriptures or the power of God?

When the dead rise, they will neither marry nor be given in marriage; they will be like the angels in heaven.

Now about the dead rising--have you not read in the Book of Moses, in the account of the burning bush, how God said to him, 'I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob'?

He is not the God of the dead, but of the living.

You are badly mistaken!"

One of the teachers of the law came and heard them debating.

Noticing that Jesus had given them a good answer, he asked him, "Of all the commandments, which is the most important?"

"The most important one," answered Jesus, "is this: 'Hear, O Israel: The Lord our God, the Lord is one.

Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind and with all your strength.'

The second is this: 'Love your neighbor as yourself.'

There is no commandment greater than these."

"Well said, teacher," the man replied.

"You are right in saying that God is one and there is no other but him.

To love him with all your heart, with all your understanding and with all your strength, and to love your neighbor as yourself is more important than all burnt offerings and sacrifices."

When Jesus saw that he had answered wisely, he said to him, "You are not far from the kingdom of God."

And from then on, no one dared ask him any more questions.

While Jesus was teaching in the temple courts, he asked, "Why do the teachers of the law say that the Messiah is the son of David?

David himself, speaking by the Holy Spirit, declared: 'The Lord said to my Lord: "Sit at my right hand until I put your enemies under your feet."'

David himself calls him 'Lord.'

How then can he be his son?"

The large crowd listened to him with delight.

As he taught, Jesus said, "Watch out for the teachers of the law.

They like to walk around in flowing robes and be greeted with respect in the marketplaces, and have the most important seats in the synagogues and the places of honor at banquets.

They devour widows' houses and for a show make lengthy prayers.

These men will be punished most severely."

Jesus sat down opposite the place where the offerings were put and watched the crowd putting their money into the temple treasury.

Many rich people threw in large amounts.

But a poor widow came and put in two very small copper coins, worth only a few cents.

Calling his disciples to him, Jesus said, "Truly I tell you, this poor widow has put more into the treasury than all the others.

They all gave out of their wealth; but she, out of her poverty, put in everything--all she had to live on."

## Mark 13

As Jesus was leaving the temple, one of his disciples said to him, "Teacher, look at these amazing stones and buildings!"

Jesus replied, "Do you see these great buildings?

Not one stone will be left on another; every one will be thrown down."

While he was sitting on the Mount of Olives opposite the temple, Peter, James, John, and Andrew asked him privately, "Tell us, when will these things happen?

And what will be the sign that they are about to be fulfilled?"

Jesus began to say to them, "Watch out that no one deceives you.

Many will come in my name, claiming, 'I am he,' and will deceive many.

When you hear of wars and rumors of wars, do not be alarmed.

Such things must happen, but the end is still to come.

Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom.

There will be earthquakes in various places, and famines.

These are the beginning of birth pains.

Be on your guard.

You will be handed over to the local councils and flogged in the synagogues.

On account of me, you will stand before governors and kings as witnesses to them.

And the gospel must first be preached to all nations.

Whenever you are arrested and brought to trial, do not worry beforehand about what to say.

Just say whatever is given you at the time, for it is not you speaking, but the Holy Spirit.

Brother will betray brother to death, and a father his child.

Children will rebel against their parents and have them put to death.

Everyone will hate you because of me, but the one who stands firm to the end will be saved.

When you see 'the abomination that causes desolation' standing where it does not belong--let the reader understand--then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains.

Let no one on the housetop go down or enter the house to take anything out.

Let no one in the field go back to get their cloak.

How dreadful it will be in those days for pregnant women and nursing mothers!

Pray that this will not take place in winter, because those will be days of distress unequaled from the beginning, when God created the world, until now--and never to be equaled again.

If the Lord had not cut short those days, no one would survive.

But for the sake of the elect, whom he has chosen, he has shortened them.

At that time if anyone says to you, 'Look, here is the Messiah!' or, 'Look, there he is!' do not believe it.

For false messiahs and false prophets will appear and perform signs and wonders to deceive, if possible, even the elect.

So be on your guard; I have told you everything ahead of time.

But in those days, following that distress, 'the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light; the stars will fall from the sky, and the heavenly bodies will be shaken.'

At that time people will see the Son of Man coming in clouds with great power and glory.

And he will send his angels and gather his elect from the four winds, from the ends of the earth to the ends of the heavens.

Now learn this lesson from the fig tree: As soon as its twigs get tender and its leaves come out, you know that summer is near.

Even so, when you see these things happening, you know that it is near, right at the door.

Truly I tell you, this generation will certainly not pass away until all these things have happened.

Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will never pass away.

But about that day or hour no one knows, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father.

Be on guard!

Be alert!

You do not know when that time will come.

It's like a man going away: He leaves his house and puts his servants in charge, each with their assigned task, and tells the one at the door to keep watch.

Therefore keep watch because you do not know when the owner of the house will come back--whether in the evening, or at midnight, or when the rooster crows, or at dawn.

If he comes suddenly, do not let him find you sleeping.

What I say to you, I say to everyone: 'Watch!'

## Mark 14

It was almost time for the Passover and the Feast of Unleavened Bread, just two days away.

The chief priests and the teachers of the law were looking for a way to arrest Jesus secretly and kill him.

They said, "Not during the festival, or the people may riot."

While Jesus was in Bethany, at the house of Simon the Leper, a woman came with a jar of very expensive perfume, made of pure nard.

She broke the jar and poured the perfume on his head.

Some of those present were saying indignantly to one another, "Why this waste of perfume?

It could have been sold for more than a year's wages and the money given to the poor."

And they rebuked her harshly.

"Leave her alone," said Jesus.

"Why are you bothering her?

She has done a beautiful thing to me.

The poor you will always have with you, and you can help them any time you want.

But you will not always have me.

She did what she could.

She poured perfume on my body beforehand to prepare for my burial.

Truly I tell you, wherever the gospel is preached throughout the world, what she has done will also be told, in memory of her."

Then Judas Iscariot, one of the Twelve, went to the chief priests to betray Jesus to them.

They were delighted to hear this and promised to give him money.

So he watched for an opportunity to hand him over.

On the first day of the Festival of Unleavened Bread, when it was customary to sacrifice the Passover lamb, Jesus' disciples asked him, "Where do you want us to go and make preparations for you to eat the Passover?"

So he sent two of his disciples, telling them, "Go into the city, and a man carrying a jar of water will meet you.

Follow him.

Say to the owner of the house he enters, 'The Teacher asks: Where is my guest room, where I may eat the Passover with my disciples?'

He will show you a large room upstairs, furnished and ready.

Make preparations for us there."

The disciples left, went into the city and found things just as Jesus had told them.

So they prepared the Passover.

When evening came, Jesus arrived with the Twelve.

While they were reclining at the table eating, he said, "Truly I tell you, one of you will betray me--one who is eating with me."

They were saddened, and one by one they said to him, "Surely you don't mean me?"

"It is one of the Twelve," he replied, "one who dips bread into the bowl with me.

The Son of Man will go just as it is written about him.

But woe to that man who betrays the Son of Man!

It would be better for him if he had not been born."

While they were eating, Jesus took bread, and when he had given thanks, he broke it and gave it to his disciples, saying, "Take it; this is my body."

Then he took a cup, and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and they all drank from it.

"This is my blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many," he said to them.

"Truly I tell you, I will not drink again from the fruit of the vine until that day when I drink it new in the kingdom of God."

When they had sung a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives.

"You will all fall away," Jesus told them, "for it is written: 'I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep will be scattered.'

But after I have risen, I will go ahead of you into Galilee."

Peter declared, "Even if all fall away, I will not."

"Truly I tell you," Jesus answered, "today--yes, tonight--before the rooster crows twice you yourself will disown me three times."

But Peter insisted emphatically, "Even if I have to die with you, I will never disown you."

And all the others said the same.

They went to a place called Gethsemane, and Jesus said to his disciples, "Sit here while I pray."

He took Peter, James and John along with him, and he began to be deeply distressed and troubled.

"My soul is overwhelmed with sorrow to the point of death," he said to them.

"Stay here and keep watch."

Going a little farther, he fell to the ground and prayed that if possible the hour might pass from him.

"Abba, Father," he said, "everything is possible for you.

Take this cup from me.

Yet not what I will, but what you will."

Then he returned to his disciples and found them sleeping.

"Simon," he said to Peter, "are you asleep?

Couldn't you keep watch for one hour?

Watch and pray so that you will not fall into temptation.

The spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak."

Once more he went away and prayed the same thing.

When he came back, he again found them sleeping, because their eyes were heavy.

They did not know what to say to him.

Returning the third time, he said to them, "Are you still sleeping and resting?

Enough!

The hour has come.

Look, the Son of Man is delivered into the hands of sinners.

Rise!

Let us go!

Here comes my betrayer!"

Just as he was speaking, Judas, one of the Twelve, appeared.

With him was a crowd armed with swords and clubs, sent from the chief priests, the teachers of the law, and the elders.

Now the betrayer had arranged a signal with them: "The one I kiss is the man; arrest him and lead him away under guard."

Going at once to Jesus, Judas said, "Rabbi!" and kissed him.

The men seized Jesus and arrested him.

Then one of those standing near drew his sword and struck the servant of the high priest, cutting off his ear.

"Am I leading a rebellion," said Jesus, "that you have come out with swords and clubs to capture me?

Every day I was with you, teaching in the temple courts, and you did not arrest me.

But the Scriptures must be fulfilled."

Then everyone deserted him and fled.

A young man, wearing nothing but a linen garment, was following Jesus.

When they seized him, he fled naked, leaving his garment behind.

They took Jesus to the high priest, and all the chief priests, the elders and the teachers of the law came together.

Peter followed him at a distance, right into the courtyard of the high priest.

There he sat with the guards and warmed himself at the fire.

The chief priests and the whole Sanhedrin were looking for evidence against Jesus so that they could put him to death, but they did not find any.

Many testified falsely against him, but their statements did not agree.

Then some stood up and gave this false testimony against him: "We heard him say, 'I will destroy this temple made with human hands and in three days will build another, not made with hands.'"

Yet even then their testimony did not agree.

Then the high priest stood up before them and asked Jesus, "Are you not going to answer?

What is this testimony that these men are bringing against you?"

But Jesus remained silent and gave no answer.

Again the high priest asked him, "Are you the Messiah, the Son of the Blessed One?"

"I am," said Jesus.

"And you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Mighty One and coming on the clouds of heaven."

The high priest tore his clothes.

"Why do we need any more witnesses?" he asked.

"You have heard the blasphemy.

What do you think?"

They all condemned him as worthy of death.

Then some began to spit at him; they blindfolded him, struck him with their fists, and said, "Prophesy!

And the guards took him and beat him.

While Peter was below in the courtyard, one of the servant girls of the high priest came by.

When she saw Peter warming himself, she looked closely at him.

"You also were with that Nazarene, Jesus," she said.

But he denied it.

"I don't know or understand what you're talking about," he said, and went out into the entryway.

When the servant girl saw him there, she said again to those standing around, "This fellow is one of them."

Again he denied it.

After a little while, those standing near said to Peter, "Surely you are one of them, for you are a Galilean."

He began to call down curses, and he swore to them, "I don't know this man you're talking about."

Immediately the rooster crowed the second time.

Then Peter remembered the word Jesus had spoken to him: "Before the rooster crows twice you will disown me three times."

And he broke down and wept.

## Mark 15

Early in the morning, the chief priests, elders, and scribes held a meeting with the whole council.

They tied up Jesus and took him to Pilate.

Pilate asked him, "Are you the King of the Jews?"

Jesus replied, "You say so."

The chief priests accused him of many things, but Jesus did not answer, which surprised Pilate.

During the festival, Pilate would release a prisoner chosen by the people.

There was a man named Barabbas, who was in prison with rebels who had committed murder.

The crowd asked Pilate to release a prisoner as usual.

Pilate asked, "Do you want me to release the King of the Jews?"

He knew the chief priests had handed Jesus over out of envy.

But the chief priests stirred up the crowd to ask for Barabbas instead.

Pilate asked, "What should I do with the one you call the King of the Jews?"

They shouted, "Crucify him!"

Pilate asked, "Why? What crime has he committed?"

But they shouted even louder, "Crucify him!"

Wanting to satisfy the crowd, Pilate released Barabbas and handed Jesus over to be crucified.

The soldiers took Jesus into the courtyard, called the Praetorium, and gathered the whole company of soldiers.

They dressed him in a purple robe, twisted a crown of thorns, and put it on his head.

They mocked him, saying, "Hail, King of the Jews!"

They hit him on the head with a staff, spit on him, and knelt in mock worship.

After mocking him, they took off the purple robe and put his own clothes back on him.

Then they led him out to crucify him.

They forced a man named Simon from Cyrene, who was coming in from the country, to carry Jesus' cross.

They brought Jesus to a place called Golgotha, which means "Place of the Skull."

They offered him wine mixed with myrrh, but he did not take it.

They crucified him and divided his clothes by casting lots to see what each would get.

It was nine in the morning when they crucified him.

The written charge against him read: THE KING OF THE JEWS.

They crucified two rebels with him, one on his right and one on his left.

Those who passed by hurled insults at him, shaking their heads and saying, "So! You who are going to destroy the temple and build it in three days, come down from the cross and save yourself!"

In the same way, the chief priests and teachers of the law mocked him among themselves, saying, "He saved others, but he can't save himself!

Let this Messiah, this King of Israel, come down now from the cross, that we may see and believe."

Those crucified with him also heaped insults on him.

At noon, darkness came over the whole land until three in the afternoon.

At three in the afternoon, Jesus cried out in a loud voice, "Eloi, Eloi, lema sabachthani?" (which means "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?")

Some of those standing near heard this and said, "Listen, he's calling Elijah."

Someone ran, filled a sponge with wine vinegar, put it on a staff, and offered it to Jesus to drink.

"Leave him alone. Let's see if Elijah comes to take him down," he said.

With a loud cry, Jesus breathed his last.

The curtain of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom.

And when the centurion, who stood there in front of Jesus, saw how he died, he said, "Surely this man was the Son of God!"

Some women were watching from a distance.

Among them were Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James the younger and of Joseph, and Salome.

In Galilee, these women had followed him and cared for his needs.

Many other women who had come up with him to Jerusalem were also there.

It was Preparation Day (that is, the day before the Sabbath).

So as evening approached, Joseph of Arimathea, a prominent member of the Council, who was himself waiting for the kingdom of God, went boldly to Pilate and asked for Jesus' body.

Pilate was surprised to hear that he was already dead.

Summoning the centurion, he asked him if Jesus had already died.

When he learned from the centurion that it was so, he gave the body to Joseph.

So Joseph bought some linen cloth, took down the body, wrapped it in the linen, and placed it in a tomb cut out of rock.

Then he rolled a stone against the entrance of the tomb.

Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joseph saw where he was laid.

## Mark 16

After the Sabbath was over, Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James, and Salome bought spices to go and anoint Jesus' body.

Early on the first day of the week, just after sunrise, they went to the tomb.

They were wondering who would roll away the stone from the entrance of the tomb for them.

But when they looked up, they saw that the stone, which was very large, had already been rolled away.

As they entered the tomb, they saw a young man dressed in a white robe sitting on the right side, and they were alarmed.

"Don't be alarmed," he said.

"You are looking for Jesus the Nazarene, who was crucified.

He has risen!

He is not here.

See the place where they laid him.

But go, tell his disciples and Peter, 'He is going ahead of you into Galilee.

There you will see him, just as he told you.'"

Trembling and bewildered, the women went out and fled from the tomb.

They said nothing to anyone because they were afraid.

When Jesus rose early on the first day of the week, he appeared first to Mary Magdalene, out of whom he had driven seven demons.

She went and told those who had been with him and who were mourning and weeping.

When they heard that Jesus was alive and that she had seen him, they did not believe it.

Afterward, Jesus appeared in a different form to two of them while they were walking in the country.

These returned and reported it to the rest, but they did not believe them either.

Later, Jesus appeared to the Eleven as they were eating; he rebuked them for their lack of faith and their stubborn refusal to believe those who had seen him after he had risen.

He said to them, "Go into all the world and preach the gospel to all creation.

Whoever believes and is baptized will be saved, but whoever does not believe will be condemned.

And these signs will accompany those who believe: In my name they will drive out demons; they will speak in new tongues; they will pick up snakes with their hands; and when they drink deadly poison, it will not hurt them at all; they will place their hands on sick people, and they will get well."

After the Lord Jesus had spoken to them, he was taken up into heaven and he sat at the right hand of God.

Then the disciples went out and preached everywhere, and the Lord worked with them and confirmed his word by the signs that accompanied it.

## Matthew 1

This is the family history of Jesus Christ, who was a descendant of David and Abraham.

Abraham was the father of Isaac, Isaac was the father of Jacob, and Jacob was the father of Judah and his brothers.

Judah was the father of Perez and Zerah, whose mother was Tamar.

Perez was the father of Hezron, Hezron was the father of Ram, Ram was the father of Amminadab, Amminadab was the father of Nahshon, Nahshon was the father of Salmon, Salmon was the father of Boaz, whose mother was Rahab.

Boaz was the father of Obed, whose mother was Ruth.

Obed was the father of Jesse, and Jesse was the father of King David.

David was the father of Solomon, whose mother had been Uriah's wife.

Solomon was the father of Rehoboam, Rehoboam was the father of Abijah, Abijah was the father of Asa, Asa was the father of Jehoshaphat, Jehoshaphat was the father of Jehoram, Jehoram was the father of Uzziah, Uzziah was the father of Jotham, Jotham was the father of Ahaz, Ahaz was the father of Hezekiah, Hezekiah was the father of Manasseh, Manasseh was the father of Amon, Amon was the father of Josiah, and Josiah was the father of Jeconiah and his brothers at the time of the exile to Babylon.

After the exile to Babylon, Jeconiah was the father of Shealtiel, Shealtiel was the father of Zerubbabel, Zerubbabel was the father of Abiud, Abiud was the father of Eliakim, Eliakim was the father of Azor, Azor was the father of Zadok, Zadok was the father of Akim, Akim was the father of Elihud, Elihud was the father of Eleazar, Eleazar was the father of Matthan, Matthan was the father of Jacob, and Jacob was the father of Joseph, the husband of Mary, who gave birth to Jesus, who is called the Messiah.

So, there were fourteen generations from Abraham to David, fourteen from David to the exile to Babylon, and fourteen from the exile to the Messiah.

This is how the birth of Jesus the Messiah came about: His mother Mary was pledged to be married to Joseph, but before they came together, she was found to be pregnant through the Holy Spirit.

Because Joseph, her husband, was faithful to the law and did not want to expose her to public disgrace, he had in mind to divorce her quietly.

But after he had considered this, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream and said, "Joseph son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary home as your wife, because what is conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit.

She will give birth to a son, and you are to give him the name Jesus, because he will save his people from their sins."

All this took place to fulfill what the Lord had said through the prophet: "The virgin will conceive and give birth to a son, and they will call him Immanuel" (which means "God with us").

When Joseph woke up, he did what the angel of the Lord had commanded him and took Mary home as his wife.

But he did not consummate their marriage until she gave birth to a son.

And he gave him the name Jesus.

## Matthew 2

When Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea during the time of King Herod, some wise men from the East came to Jerusalem.

They asked, "Where is the newborn king of the Jews?

We saw his star in the East and have come to worship him."

When King Herod heard this, he was troubled, and all of Jerusalem with him.

He gathered all the chief priests and scribes of the people and asked them where the Christ was to be born.

They told him, "In Bethlehem of Judea, for this is what the prophet wrote: 'And you, Bethlehem, in the land of Judah, are by no means least among the rulers of Judah; for out of you will come a ruler who will shepherd my people Israel.'"

Then Herod secretly called the wise men and found out from them the exact time the star had appeared.

He sent them to Bethlehem and said, "Go and search carefully for the child.

When you find him, report back to me so that I too may go and worship him."

After hearing the king, they went on their way, and the star they had seen in the East went ahead of them until it stopped over the place where the child was.

When they saw the star, they were overjoyed.

They went into the house and saw the child with Mary, his mother, and they bowed down and worshiped him.

They opened their treasures and presented him with gifts of gold, frankincense, and myrrh.

Having been warned in a dream not to return to Herod, they went back to their country by another route.

After they had left, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream and said, "Get up, take the child and his mother, and escape to Egypt.

Stay there until I tell you, for Herod is going to search for the child to kill him."

So Joseph got up, took the child and his mother during the night, and left for Egypt, where they stayed until the death of Herod.

This fulfilled what the Lord had said through the prophet: "Out of Egypt I called my son."

When Herod realized that he had been outwitted by the wise men, he was furious, and he ordered the killing of all the boys in Bethlehem and its vicinity who were two years old and under, according to the time he had learned from the wise men.

Then what was said through the prophet Jeremiah was fulfilled: "A voice is heard in Ramah, weeping and great mourning, Rachel weeping for her children and refusing to be comforted, because they are no more."

After Herod died, an angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt and said, "Get up, take the child and his mother, and go to the land of Israel, for those who were trying to take the child's life are dead."

So Joseph got up, took the child and his mother, and went to the land of Israel.

But when he heard that Archelaus was reigning in Judea in place of his father Herod, he was afraid to go there.

Having been warned in a dream, he withdrew to the district of Galilee, and he went and lived in a town called Nazareth.

So was fulfilled what was said through the prophets: "He will be called a Nazarene."

## Matthew 3

In those days, John the Baptist came to the desert of Judea, telling people to change their ways because the kingdom of heaven was near.

He was the one spoken about by the prophet Isaiah, who said, "A voice is calling in the desert, 'Prepare the way for the Lord, make straight paths for him.'"

John wore clothes made of camel's hair and had a leather belt around his waist.

His food was locusts and wild honey.

People from Jerusalem, all of Judea, and the area around the Jordan River came to him.

They confessed their sins and were baptized by him in the Jordan River.

When John saw many Pharisees and Sadducees coming to be baptized, he said to them, "You brood of vipers! Who warned you to escape the coming wrath?

Produce fruit in keeping with repentance.

And don't think you can say to yourselves, 'We have Abraham as our father.'

I tell you that out of these stones God can raise up children for Abraham.

The ax is already at the root of the trees, and every tree that does not produce good fruit will be cut down and thrown into the fire.

I baptize you with water for repentance.

But after me comes someone more powerful than I, whose sandals I am not worthy to carry.

He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire.

His winnowing fork is in his hand, and he will clear his threshing floor, gathering his wheat into the barn and burning up the chaff with unquenchable fire."

Then Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan to be baptized by John.

But John tried to stop him, saying, "I need to be baptized by you, and you come to me?"

Jesus replied, "Let it be so now; it is proper for us to do this to fulfill all righteousness."

Then John agreed.

As soon as Jesus was baptized, he came up out of the water.

At that moment, heaven was opened, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and landing on him.

And a voice from heaven said, "This is my Son, whom I love; with him I am well pleased."

## Matthew 4

Then Jesus was led by the Spirit into the desert to be tempted by the devil.

After fasting for forty days and forty nights, he was hungry.

The tempter came to him and said, "If you are the Son of God, tell these stones to become bread."

Jesus answered, "It is written: 'Man shall not live on bread alone, but on every word that comes from the mouth of God.'"

Then the devil took him to the holy city and had him stand on the highest point of the temple.

"If you are the Son of God," he said, "throw yourself down.

For it is written: 'He will command his angels concerning you, and they will lift you up in their hands, so that you will not strike your foot against a stone.'"

Jesus answered him, "It is also written: 'Do not put the Lord your God to the test.'"

Again, the devil took him to a very high mountain and showed him all the kingdoms of the world and their splendor.

"All this I will give you," he said, "if you will bow down and worship me."

Jesus said to him, "Away from me, Satan! For it is written: 'Worship the Lord your God, and serve him only.'"

Then the devil left him, and angels came and attended him.

When Jesus heard that John had been put in prison, he withdrew to Galilee.

Leaving Nazareth, he went and lived in Capernaum, which was by the lake in the area of Zebulun and Naphtali, to fulfill what was said through the prophet Isaiah:

"Land of Zebulun and land of Naphtali, the Way of the Sea, beyond the Jordan, Galilee of the Gentiles-- the people living in darkness have seen a great light; on those living in the land of the shadow of death a light has dawned."

From that time on Jesus began to preach, "Repent, for the kingdom of heaven has come near."

As Jesus was walking beside the Sea of Galilee, he saw two brothers, Simon called Peter and his brother Andrew.

They were casting a net into the lake, for they were fishermen.

"Come, follow me," Jesus said, "and I will send you out to fish for people."

At once they left their nets and followed him.

Going on from there, he saw two other brothers, James son of Zebedee and his brother John.

They were in a boat with their father Zebedee, preparing their nets.

Jesus called them, and immediately they left the boat and their father and followed him.

Jesus went throughout Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, proclaiming the good news of the kingdom, and healing every disease and sickness among the people.

News about him spread all over Syria, and people brought to him all who were ill with various diseases, those suffering severe pain, the demon-possessed, those having seizures, and the paralyzed; and he healed them.

Large crowds from Galilee, the Decapolis, Jerusalem, Judea, and the region across the Jordan followed him.

## Matthew 5

Seeing the crowds, he went up on a mountain and sat down.

His disciples came to him, and he began to teach them, saying:

Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.

Blessed are those who mourn, for they will be comforted.

Blessed are the meek, for they will inherit the earth.

Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they will be filled.

Blessed are the merciful, for they will be shown mercy.

Blessed are the pure in heart, for they will see God.

Blessed are the peacemakers, for they will be called children of God.

Blessed are those who are persecuted because of righteousness, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.

Blessed are you when people insult you, persecute you, and falsely say all kinds of evil against you because of me.

Rejoice and be glad, because great is your reward in heaven, for in the same way they persecuted the prophets who were before you.

You are the salt of the earth.

But if the salt loses its saltiness, how can it be made salty again?

It is no longer good for anything, except to be thrown out and trampled underfoot.

You are the light of the world.

A town built on a hill cannot be hidden.

Neither do people light a lamp and put it under a bowl.

Instead, they put it on its stand, and it gives light to everyone in the house.

In the same way, let your light shine before others, that they may see your good deeds and glorify your Father in heaven.

Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them.

For truly I tell you, until heaven and earth disappear, not the smallest letter, not the least stroke of a pen, will by any means disappear from the Law until everything is accomplished.

Therefore, anyone who sets aside one of the least of these commands and teaches others accordingly will be called least in the kingdom of heaven, but whoever practices and teaches these commands will be called great in the kingdom of heaven.

For I tell you that unless your righteousness surpasses that of the Pharisees and the teachers of the law, you will certainly not enter the kingdom of heaven.

You have heard that it was said to the people long ago, 'You shall not murder, and anyone who murders will be subject to judgment.'

But I tell you that anyone who is angry with a brother or sister will be subject to judgment.

Again, anyone who says to a brother or sister, 'Raca,' is answerable to the court.

And anyone who says, 'You fool!' will be in danger of the fire of hell.

Therefore, if you are offering your gift at the altar and there remember that your brother or sister has something against you, leave your gift there in front of the altar.

First go and be reconciled to them; then come and offer your gift.

Settle matters quickly with your adversary who is taking you to court.

Do it while you are still together on the way, or your adversary may hand you over to the judge, and the judge may hand you over to the officer, and you may be thrown into prison.

Truly I tell you, you will not get out until you have paid the last penny.

You have heard that it was said, 'You shall not commit adultery.'

But I tell you that anyone who looks at a woman lustfully has already committed adultery with her in his heart.

If your right eye causes you to stumble, gouge it out and throw it away.

It is better for you to lose one part of your body than for your whole body to be thrown into hell.

And if your right hand causes you to stumble, cut it off and throw it away.

It is better for you to lose one part of your body than for your whole body to go into hell.

It has been said, 'Anyone who divorces his wife must give her a certificate of divorce.'

But I tell you that anyone who divorces his wife, except for sexual immorality, makes her the victim of adultery, and anyone who marries a divorced woman commits adultery.

Again, you have heard that it was said to the people long ago, 'Do not break your oath, but fulfill to the Lord the vows you have made.'

But I tell you, do not swear an oath at all: either by heaven, for it is God's throne; or by the earth, for it is his footstool; or by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the Great King.

And do not swear by your head, for you cannot make even one hair white or black.

All you need to say is simply 'Yes' or 'No'; anything beyond this comes from the evil one.

You have heard that it was said, 'Eye for eye, and tooth for tooth.'

But I tell you, do not resist an evil person.

If anyone slaps you on the right cheek, turn to them the other cheek also.

And if anyone wants to sue you and take your shirt, hand over your coat as well.

If anyone forces you to go one mile, go with them two miles.

Give to the one who asks you, and do not turn away from the one who wants to borrow from you.

You have heard that it was said, 'Love your neighbor and hate your enemy.'

But I tell you, love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you, that you may be children of your Father in heaven.

He causes his sun to rise on the evil and the good, and sends rain on the righteous and the unrighteous.

If you love those who love you, what reward will you get?

Are not even the tax collectors doing that?

And if you greet only your own people, what are you doing more than others?

Do not even pagans do that?

Be perfect, therefore, as your heavenly Father is perfect.

## Matthew 6

Be careful not to show off your good deeds in front of others just to be seen by them.

If you do, you won't get any reward from your Father in heaven.

So when you give to the needy, don't announce it with trumpets like the hypocrites do in the synagogues and on the streets to be honored by others.

Truly I tell you, they have received their reward in full.

But when you give to the needy, don't let your left hand know what your right hand is doing, so that your giving may be in secret.

Then your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you.

And when you pray, don't be like the hypocrites, for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and on the street corners to be seen by others.

Truly I tell you, they have received their reward in full.

But when you pray, go into your room, close the door and pray to your Father, who is unseen.

Then your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you.

And when you pray, don't keep on babbling like pagans, for they think they will be heard because of their many words.

Don't be like them, for your Father knows what you need before you ask him.

This, then, is how you should pray:

"Our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name, your kingdom come, your will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.

Give us today our daily bread.

And forgive us our debts, as we also have forgiven our debtors.

And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from the evil one."

For if you forgive other people when they sin against you, your heavenly Father will also forgive you.

But if you do not forgive others their sins, your Father will not forgive your sins.

When you fast, don't look somber as the hypocrites do, for they disfigure their faces to show others they are fasting.

Truly I tell you, they have received their reward in full.

But when you fast, put oil on your head and wash your face, so that it will not be obvious to others that you are fasting, but only to your Father, who is unseen; and your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you.

Do not store up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moths and vermin destroy, and where thieves break in and steal.

But store up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where moths and vermin do not destroy, and where thieves do not break in and steal.

For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.

The eye is the lamp of the body.

If your eyes are healthy, your whole body will be full of light.

But if your eyes are unhealthy, your whole body will be full of darkness.

If then the light within you is darkness, how great is that darkness!

No one can serve two masters.

Either you will hate the one and love the other, or you will be devoted to the one and despise the other.

You cannot serve both God and money.

Therefore I tell you, do not worry about your life, what you will eat or drink; or about your body, what you will wear.

Is not life more than food, and the body more than clothes?

Look at the birds of the air; they do not sow or reap or store away in barns, and yet your heavenly Father feeds them.

Are you not much more valuable than they?

Can any one of you by worrying add a single hour to your life?

And why do you worry about clothes?

See how the flowers of the field grow.

They do not labor or spin.

Yet I tell you that not even Solomon in all his splendor was dressed like one of these.

If that is how God clothes the grass of the field, which is here today and tomorrow is thrown into the fire, will he not much more clothe you--you of little faith?

So do not worry, saying, "What shall we eat?" or "What shall we drink?" or "What shall we wear?"

For the pagans run after all these things, and your heavenly Father knows that you need them.

But seek first his kingdom and his righteousness, and all these things will be given to you as well.

Therefore do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about itself.

Each day has enough trouble of its own.

## Matthew 7

Don't judge others so you won't be judged.

The way you judge others is how you will be judged, and the measure you use will be used on you.

Why do you notice the small speck in your brother's eye but ignore the big log in your own eye?

How can you say to your brother, "Let me take the speck out of your eye," when there's a log in your own eye?

You hypocrite, first take the log out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to remove the speck from your brother's eye.

Don't give what is holy to dogs, and don't throw your pearls to pigs, or they will trample them underfoot and turn to attack you.

Ask, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock, and the door will be opened to you.

Everyone who asks receives, the one who seeks finds, and to the one who knocks, the door will be opened.

Which of you, if your son asks for bread, will give him a stone?

Or if he asks for a fish, will give him a snake?

If you, who are not perfect, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father in heaven give good things to those who ask Him!

So, in everything, do to others what you would have them do to you, for this sums up the Law and the Prophets.

Enter through the narrow gate.

For wide is the gate and broad is the road that leads to destruction, and many enter through it.

But small is the gate and narrow the road that leads to life, and only a few find it.

Watch out for false prophets.

They come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are ferocious wolves.

By their fruit, you will recognize them.

Do people pick grapes from thornbushes or figs from thistles?

Likewise, every good tree bears good fruit, but a bad tree bears bad fruit.

A good tree cannot bear bad fruit, and a bad tree cannot bear good fruit.

Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.

Thus, by their fruit, you will recognize them.

Not everyone who says to me, "Lord, Lord," will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only the one who does the will of my Father who is in heaven.

Many will say to me on that day, "Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name and in your name drive out demons and perform many miracles?"

Then I will tell them plainly, "I never knew you. Away from me, you evildoers!"

Therefore, everyone who hears these words of mine and puts them into practice is like a wise man who built his house on the rock.

The rain came down, the streams rose, and the winds blew and beat against that house; yet it did not fall, because it had its foundation on the rock.

But everyone who hears these words of mine and does not put them into practice is like a foolish man who built his house on sand.

The rain came down, the streams rose, and the winds blew and beat against that house, and it fell with a great crash.

When Jesus had finished saying these things, the crowds were amazed at his teaching, because he taught as one who had authority, and not as their teachers of the law.

## Matthew 8

As he came down from the mountain, many people followed him.

A man with leprosy came and knelt before him, saying, "Lord, if you are willing, you can make me clean."

Jesus reached out his hand and touched the man, saying, "I am willing. Be clean!"

Immediately, the leprosy left him.

Jesus told him, "See that you don't tell anyone, but go, show yourself to the priest and offer the gift Moses commanded, as a testimony to them."

When Jesus entered Capernaum, a centurion came to him, asking for help.

"Lord," he said, "my servant lies at home paralyzed, suffering terribly."

Jesus said to him, "Shall I come and heal him?"

The centurion replied, "Lord, I do not deserve to have you come under my roof.

But just say the word, and my servant will be healed.

For I myself am a man under authority, with soldiers under me.

I tell this one, 'Go,' and he goes; and that one, 'Come,' and he comes.

I say to my servant, 'Do this,' and he does it."

When Jesus heard this, he was amazed and said to those following him, "Truly I tell you, I have not found anyone in Israel with such great faith.

I say to you that many will come from the east and the west, and will take their places at the feast with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven.

But the subjects of the kingdom will be thrown outside, into the darkness, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth."

Then Jesus said to the centurion, "Go! Let it be done just as you believed it would."

And his servant was healed at that moment.

When Jesus came into Peter's house, he saw Peter's mother-in-law lying in bed with a fever.

He touched her hand and the fever left her, and she got up and began to wait on him.

When evening came, many who were demon-possessed were brought to him, and he drove out the spirits with a word and healed all the sick.

This was to fulfill what was spoken through the prophet Isaiah: "He took up our infirmities and bore our diseases."

When Jesus saw the crowd around him, he gave orders to cross to the other side of the lake.

Then a teacher of the law came to him and said, "Teacher, I will follow you wherever you go."

Jesus replied, "Foxes have dens and birds have nests, but the Son of Man has no place to lay his head."

Another disciple said to him, "Lord, first let me go and bury my father."

But Jesus told him, "Follow me, and let the dead bury their own dead."

Then he got into the boat and his disciples followed him.

Suddenly a furious storm came up on the lake, so that the waves swept over the boat.

But Jesus was sleeping.

The disciples went and woke him, saying, "Lord, save us! We're going to drown!"

He replied, "You of little faith, why are you so afraid?"

Then he got up and rebuked the winds and the waves, and it was completely calm.

The men were amazed and asked, "What kind of man is this? Even the winds and the waves obey him!"

When he arrived at the other side in the region of the Gadarenes, two demon-possessed men coming from the tombs met him.

They were so violent that no one could pass that way.

"What do you want with us, Son of God?" they shouted.

"Have you come here to torture us before the appointed time?"

Some distance from them a large herd of pigs was feeding.

The demons begged Jesus, "If you drive us out, send us into the herd of pigs."

He said to them, "Go!"

So they came out and went into the pigs, and the whole herd rushed down the steep bank into the lake and died in the water.

Those tending the pigs ran off, went into the town and reported all this, including what had happened to the demon-possessed men.

Then the whole town went out to meet Jesus.

And when they saw him, they pleaded with him to leave their region.

## Matthew 9

Jesus got into a boat and went to his own town.

Some people brought him a paralyzed man lying on a bed.

Seeing their faith, Jesus said to the paralyzed man, "Take heart, son; your sins are forgiven."

Some teachers of the law thought to themselves, "This man is blaspheming!"

Knowing their thoughts, Jesus said, "Why do you entertain evil thoughts in your hearts?

Which is easier: to say, 'Your sins are forgiven,' or to say, 'Get up and walk'?

But to show you that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins..."

Then he said to the paralyzed man, "Get up, take your mat and go home."

And the man got up and went home.

When the crowd saw this, they were filled with awe and praised God, who had given such authority to men.

As Jesus went on from there, he saw a man named Matthew sitting at the tax collector's booth.

"Follow me," he told him, and Matthew got up and followed him.

While Jesus was having dinner at Matthew's house, many tax collectors and sinners came and ate with him and his disciples.

When the Pharisees saw this, they asked his disciples, "Why does your teacher eat with tax collectors and sinners?"

On hearing this, Jesus said, "It is not the healthy who need a doctor, but the sick.

But go and learn what this means: 'I desire mercy, not sacrifice.'

For I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners."

Then John's disciples came and asked him, "How is it that we and the Pharisees fast often, but your disciples do not fast?"

Jesus answered, "How can the guests of the bridegroom mourn while he is with them?

The time will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them; then they will fast.

No one sews a patch of unshrunk cloth on an old garment, for the patch will pull away from the garment, making the tear worse.

Neither do people pour new wine into old wineskins.

If they do, the skins will burst; the wine will run out and the wineskins will be ruined.

No, they pour new wine into new wineskins, and both are preserved."

While he was saying this, a synagogue leader came and knelt before him and said, "My daughter has just died.

But come and put your hand on her, and she will live."

Jesus got up and went with him, and so did his disciples.

Just then a woman who had been subject to bleeding for twelve years came up behind him and touched the edge of his cloak.

She said to herself, "If I only touch his cloak, I will be healed."

Jesus turned and saw her.

"Take heart, daughter," he said, "your faith has healed you."

And the woman was healed at that moment.

When Jesus entered the synagogue leader's house and saw the noisy crowd and people playing pipes, he said, "Go away.

The girl is not dead but asleep."

But they laughed at him.

After the crowd had been put outside, he went in and took the girl by the hand, and she got up.

News of this spread through all that region.

As Jesus went on from there, two blind men followed him, calling out, "Have mercy on us, Son of David!"

When he had gone indoors, the blind men came to him, and he asked them, "Do you believe that I am able to do this?"

"Yes, Lord," they replied.

Then he touched their eyes and said, "According to your faith let it be done to you"; and their sight was restored.

Jesus warned them sternly, "See that no one knows about this."

But they went out and spread the news about him all over that region.

While they were going out, a man who was demon-possessed and could not talk was brought to Jesus.

And when the demon was driven out, the man who had been mute spoke.

The crowd was amazed and said, "Nothing like this has ever been seen in Israel."

But the Pharisees said, "It is by the prince of demons that he drives out demons."

Jesus went through all the towns and villages, teaching in their synagogues, proclaiming the good news of the kingdom and healing every disease and sickness.

When he saw the crowds, he had compassion on them, because they were harassed and helpless, like sheep without a shepherd.

Then he said to his disciples, "The harvest is plentiful but the workers are few.

Ask the Lord of the harvest, therefore, to send out workers into his harvest field."

## Matthew 10

Jesus called his twelve disciples and gave them the power to drive out evil spirits and heal every disease and sickness.

The names of the twelve apostles are: Simon, also called Peter, his brother Andrew, James son of Zebedee, his brother John, Philip, Bartholomew, Thomas, Matthew the tax collector, James son of Alphaeus, Thaddaeus, Simon the Zealot, and Judas Iscariot, who later betrayed him.

Jesus sent these twelve out with instructions: "Do not go to the Gentiles or enter any Samaritan town.

Instead, go to the lost sheep of Israel.

As you go, proclaim this message: 'The kingdom of heaven has come near.'

Heal the sick, raise the dead, cleanse those who have leprosy, drive out demons.

Freely you have received; freely give.

Do not take any gold, silver, or copper in your belts; no bag for the journey or extra shirt or sandals or a staff, for the worker is worth his keep.

Whatever town or village you enter, search for some worthy person there and stay at their house until you leave.

As you enter the home, give it your greeting.

If the home is deserving, let your peace rest on it; if it is not, let your peace return to you.

If anyone will not welcome you or listen to your words, leave that home or town and shake the dust off your feet.

Truly I tell you, it will be more bearable for Sodom and Gomorrah on the day of judgment than for that town.

I am sending you out like sheep among wolves.

Therefore be as shrewd as snakes and as innocent as doves.

Be on your guard; you will be handed over to the local councils and be flogged in the synagogues.

On my account, you will be brought before governors and kings as witnesses to them and to the Gentiles.

But when they arrest you, do not worry about what to say or how to say it.

At that time you will be given what to say, for it will not be you speaking, but the Spirit of your Father speaking through you.

Brother will betray brother to death, and a father his child; children will rebel against their parents and have them put to death.

You will be hated by everyone because of me, but the one who stands firm to the end will be saved.

When you are persecuted in one place, flee to another.

Truly I tell you, you will not finish going through the towns of Israel before the Son of Man comes.

The student is not above the teacher, nor a servant above his master.

It is enough for students to be like their teachers, and servants like their masters.

If the head of the house has been called Beelzebul, how much more the members of his household!

So do not be afraid of them, for there is nothing concealed that will not be disclosed, or hidden that will not be made known.

What I tell you in the dark, speak in the daylight; what is whispered in your ear, proclaim from the roofs.

Do not be afraid of those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul.

Rather, be afraid of the One who can destroy both soul and body in hell.

Are not two sparrows sold for a penny?

Yet not one of them will fall to the ground outside your Father's care.

And even the very hairs of your head are all numbered.

So don't be afraid; you are worth more than many sparrows.

Whoever acknowledges me before others, I will also acknowledge before my Father in heaven.

But whoever disowns me before others, I will disown before my Father in heaven.

Do not suppose that I have come to bring peace to the earth.

I did not come to bring peace, but a sword.

For I have come to turn 'a man against his father, a daughter against her mother, a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law-- a man's enemies will be the members of his own household.'

Anyone who loves their father or mother more than me is not worthy of me; anyone who loves their son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me.

Whoever does not take up their cross and follow me is not worthy of me.

Whoever finds their life will lose it, and whoever loses their life for my sake will find it.

Anyone who welcomes you welcomes me, and anyone who welcomes me welcomes the one who sent me.

Whoever welcomes a prophet as a prophet will receive a prophet's reward, and whoever welcomes a righteous person as a righteous person will receive a righteous person's reward.

And if anyone gives even a cup of cold water to one of these little ones who is my disciple, truly I tell you, that person will certainly not lose their reward.

## Matthew 11

When Jesus finished giving instructions to his twelve disciples, he went on to teach and preach in their towns.

John, who was in prison, heard about what Jesus was doing and sent his disciples to ask him, "Are you the one who is to come, or should we expect someone else?"

Jesus replied, "Go back and tell John what you hear and see: the blind receive sight, the lame walk, those with leprosy are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, and the good news is proclaimed to the poor.

Blessed is anyone who does not stumble on account of me."

As John's disciples were leaving, Jesus began to speak to the crowd about John: "What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed swayed by the wind?

If not, what did you go out to see? A man dressed in fine clothes?

No, those who wear fine clothes are in kings' palaces.

Then what did you go out to see? A prophet?

Yes, I tell you, and more than a prophet.

This is the one about whom it is written: 'I will send my messenger ahead of you, who will prepare your way before you.'

Truly I tell you, among those born of women there has not risen anyone greater than John the Baptist; yet whoever is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he.

From the days of John the Baptist until now, the kingdom of heaven has been subjected to violence, and violent people have been raiding it.

For all the Prophets and the Law prophesied until John.

And if you are willing to accept it, he is the Elijah who was to come.

Whoever has ears, let them hear.

"To what can I compare this generation?

They are like children sitting in the marketplaces and calling out to others: 'We played the pipe for you, and you did not dance; we sang a dirge, and you did not mourn.'

For John came neither eating nor drinking, and they say, 'He has a demon.'

The Son of Man came eating and drinking, and they say, 'Here is a glutton and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners.'

But wisdom is proved right by her deeds."

Then Jesus began to denounce the towns in which most of his miracles had been performed, because they did not repent.

"Woe to you, Chorazin!

Woe to you, Bethsaida!

For if the miracles that were performed in you had been performed in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes.

But I tell you, it will be more bearable for Tyre and Sidon on the day of judgment than for you.

And you, Capernaum, will you be lifted to the heavens?

No, you will go down to Hades.

For if the miracles that were performed in you had been performed in Sodom, it would have remained to this day.

But I tell you that it will be more bearable for Sodom on the day of judgment than for you."

At that time Jesus said, "I praise you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because you have hidden these things from the wise and learned, and revealed them to little children.

Yes, Father, for this is what you were pleased to do.

All things have been committed to me by my Father.

No one knows the Son except the Father, and no one knows the Father except the Son and those to whom the Son chooses to reveal him.

"Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest.

Take my yoke upon you and learn from me, for I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls.

For my yoke is easy and my burden is light."

## Matthew 12

At that time, Jesus was walking through the grain fields on the Sabbath, and his disciples were hungry.

They began to pick some heads of grain and eat them.

When the Pharisees saw this, they said to him, "Look, your disciples are doing what is not lawful on the Sabbath."

But he said to them, "Haven't you read what David did when he and his companions were hungry?

He entered the house of God, and he and his companions ate the consecrated bread, which was not lawful for them to do, but only for the priests.

Or haven't you read in the Law that on the Sabbath the priests in the temple desecrate the day and yet are innocent?

I tell you that something greater than the temple is here.

If you had known what these words mean, 'I desire mercy, not sacrifice,' you would not have condemned the innocent.

For the Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath."

Then Jesus went into their synagogue, and a man with a shriveled hand was there.

Looking for a reason to accuse Jesus, they asked him, "Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath?"

He said to them, "If any of you has a sheep and it falls into a pit on the Sabbath, will you not take hold of it and lift it out?

How much more valuable is a person than a sheep!

Therefore it is lawful to do good on the Sabbath."

Then he said to the man, "Stretch out your hand."

So he stretched it out and it was completely restored, just as sound as the other.

But the Pharisees went out and plotted how they might kill Jesus.

Aware of this, Jesus withdrew from that place.

A large crowd followed him, and he healed all who were ill.

He warned them not to tell others about him.

This was to fulfill what was spoken through the prophet Isaiah: "Here is my servant whom I have chosen, the one I love, in whom I delight; I will put my Spirit on him, and he will proclaim justice to the nations.

He will not quarrel or cry out; no one will hear his voice in the streets.

A bruised reed he will not break, and a smoldering wick he will not snuff out, till he has brought justice through to victory.

In his name the nations will put their hope."

Then they brought him a demon-possessed man who was blind and mute, and Jesus healed him, so that he could both talk and see.

All the people were astonished and said, "Could this be the Son of David?"

But when the Pharisees heard this, they said, "It is only by Beelzebul, the prince of demons, that this fellow drives out demons."

Jesus knew their thoughts and said to them, "Every kingdom divided against itself will be ruined, and every city or household divided against itself will not stand.

If Satan drives out Satan, he is divided against himself.

How then can his kingdom stand?

And if I drive out demons by Beelzebul, by whom do your people drive them out?

So then, they will be your judges.

But if it is by the Spirit of God that I drive out demons, then the kingdom of God has come upon you.

Or again, how can anyone enter a strong man's house and carry off his possessions unless he first ties up the strong man?

Then he can plunder his house.

Whoever is not with me is against me, and whoever does not gather with me scatters.

And so I tell you, every kind of sin and slander can be forgiven, but blasphemy against the Spirit will not be forgiven.

Anyone who speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven, but anyone who speaks against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven, either in this age or in the age to come.

Make a tree good and its fruit will be good, or make a tree bad and its fruit will be bad, for a tree is recognized by its fruit.

You brood of vipers, how can you who are evil say anything good?

For the mouth speaks what the heart is full of.

A good man brings good things out of the good stored up in him, and an evil man brings evil things out of the evil stored up in him.

But I tell you that everyone will have to give account on the day of judgment for every empty word they have spoken.

For by your words you will be acquitted, and by your words you will be condemned."

Then some of the Pharisees and teachers of the law said to him, "Teacher, we want to see a sign from you."

He answered, "A wicked and adulterous generation asks for a sign!

But none will be given it except the sign of the prophet Jonah.

For as Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of a huge fish, so the Son of Man will be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth.

The men of Nineveh will stand up at the judgment with this generation and condemn it; for they repented at the preaching of Jonah, and now something greater than Jonah is here.

The Queen of the South will rise at the judgment with this generation and condemn it; for she came from the ends of the earth to listen to Solomon's wisdom, and now something greater than Solomon is here.

When an impure spirit comes out of a person, it goes through arid places seeking rest and does not find it.

Then it says, 'I will return to the house I left.'

When it arrives, it finds the house unoccupied, swept clean and put in order.

Then it goes and takes with it seven other spirits more wicked than itself, and they go in and live there.

And the final condition of that person is worse than the first.

That is how it will be with this wicked generation."

While Jesus was still talking to the crowd, his mother and brothers stood outside, wanting to speak to him.

Someone told him, "Your mother and brothers are standing outside, wanting to speak to you."

He replied to him, "Who is my mother, and who are my brothers?"

Pointing to his disciples, he said, "Here are my mother and my brothers.

For whoever does the will of my Father in heaven is my brother and sister and mother."

## Matthew 13

On that day, Jesus left the house and sat by the sea.

Many people gathered around him, so he got into a boat and sat down while the crowd stood on the shore.

He spoke to them in parables, saying, "A farmer went out to sow seeds.

As he was sowing, some seeds fell on the path, and birds came and ate them.

Other seeds fell on rocky ground where there wasn't much soil, so they sprouted quickly but withered under the sun because they had no roots.

Some seeds fell among thorns, and the thorns grew and choked them.

But some seeds fell on good soil and produced a crop, some a hundredfold, some sixty, and some thirty.

Whoever has ears, let them hear."

The disciples came to him and asked, "Why do you speak to them in parables?"

He replied, "Because the knowledge of the secrets of the kingdom of heaven has been given to you, but not to them.

Whoever has will be given more, and they will have an abundance.

Whoever does not have, even what they have will be taken from them.

This is why I speak to them in parables: though seeing, they do not see; though hearing, they do not hear or understand.

In them is fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah: 'You will be ever hearing but never understanding; you will be ever seeing but never perceiving.'

For this people's heart has become calloused; they hardly hear with their ears, and they have closed their eyes.

Otherwise, they might see with their eyes, hear with their ears, understand with their hearts, and turn, and I would heal them.

But blessed are your eyes because they see, and your ears because they hear.

Truly I tell you, many prophets and righteous people longed to see what you see but did not see it, and to hear what you hear but did not hear it.

"Listen then to what the parable of the sower means: When anyone hears the message about the kingdom and does not understand it, the evil one comes and snatches away what was sown in their heart.

This is the seed sown along the path.

The seed falling on rocky ground refers to someone who hears the word and at once receives it with joy.

But since they have no root, they last only a short time.

When trouble or persecution comes because of the word, they quickly fall away.

The seed falling among the thorns refers to someone who hears the word, but the worries of this life and the deceitfulness of wealth choke the word, making it unfruitful.

But the seed falling on good soil refers to someone who hears the word and understands it.

This is the one who produces a crop, yielding a hundred, sixty, or thirty times what was sown.

He told them another parable: "The kingdom of heaven is like a man who sowed good seed in his field.

But while everyone was sleeping, his enemy came and sowed weeds among the wheat and went away.

When the wheat sprouted and formed heads, then the weeds also appeared.

The owner's servants came to him and said, 'Sir, didn't you sow good seed in your field? Where then did the weeds come from?'

'An enemy did this,' he replied.

The servants asked him, 'Do you want us to go and pull them up?'

'No,' he answered, 'because while you are pulling the weeds, you may uproot the wheat with them.

Let both grow together until the harvest.

At that time, I will tell the harvesters: First collect the weeds and tie them in bundles to be burned; then gather the wheat and bring it into my barn.'"

He told them another parable: "The kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed, which a man took and planted in his field.

Though it is the smallest of all seeds, yet when it grows, it is the largest of garden plants and becomes a tree, so that the birds come and perch in its branches."

He told them still another parable: "The kingdom of heaven is like yeast that a woman took and mixed into about sixty pounds of flour until it worked all through the dough."

Jesus spoke all these things to the crowd in parables; he did not say anything to them without using a parable.

So was fulfilled what was spoken through the prophet: "I will open my mouth in parables, I will utter things hidden since the creation of the world."

Then he left the crowd and went into the house.

His disciples came to him and said, "Explain to us the parable of the weeds in the field."

He answered, "The one who sowed the good seed is the Son of Man.

The field is the world, and the good seed stands for the people of the kingdom.

The weeds are the people of the evil one, and the enemy who sows them is the devil.

The harvest is the end of the age, and the harvesters are angels.

As the weeds are pulled up and burned in the fire, so it will be at the end of the age.

The Son of Man will send out his angels, and they will weed out of his kingdom everything that causes sin and all who do evil.

They will throw them into the blazing furnace, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.

Then the righteous will shine like the sun in the kingdom of their Father.

Whoever has ears, let them hear.

"The kingdom of heaven is like treasure hidden in a field.

When a man found it, he hid it again, and then in his joy went and sold all he had and bought that field.

Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant looking for fine pearls.

When he found one of great value, he went away and sold everything he had and bought it.

Once again, the kingdom of heaven is like a net that was let down into the lake and caught all kinds of fish.

When it was full, the fishermen pulled it up on the shore.

Then they sat down and collected the good fish in baskets, but threw the bad away.

This is how it will be at the end of the age.

The angels will come and separate the wicked from the righteous and throw them into the blazing furnace, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.

"Have you understood all these things?" Jesus asked.

"Yes," they replied.

He said to them, "Therefore every teacher of the law who has become a disciple in the kingdom of heaven is like the owner of a house who brings out of his storeroom new treasures as well as old."

When Jesus had finished these parables, he moved on from there.

Coming to his hometown, he began teaching the people in their synagogue, and they were amazed.

"Where did this man get this wisdom and these miraculous powers?" they asked.

"Isn't this the carpenter's son?

Isn't his mother's name Mary, and aren't his brothers James, Joseph, Simon, and Judas?

Aren't all his sisters with us?

Where then did this man get all these things?"

And they took offense at him.

But Jesus said to them, "A prophet is not without honor except in his own town and in his own home."

And he did not do many miracles there because of their lack of faith.

## Matthew 14

At that time, Herod the ruler heard about Jesus and said to his servants, "This is John the Baptist.

He has risen from the dead, and that's why he can do these powerful things."

Herod had arrested John, tied him up, and put him in prison because of Herodias, his brother Philip's wife.

John had told Herod, "It's not right for you to have her as your wife."

Herod wanted to kill John but was afraid of the people because they thought John was a prophet.

During Herod's birthday party, Herodias's daughter danced for the guests and pleased Herod.

So he promised with an oath to give her whatever she asked.

Prompted by her mother, she said, "Give me John the Baptist's head on a platter."

The king was sad, but because of his promise and the guests, he ordered it to be done.

He sent men to the prison to behead John, and they brought his head on a platter and gave it to the girl, who gave it to her mother.

John's disciples came, took his body, and buried it.

Then they went and told Jesus.

When Jesus heard this, he left in a boat to a quiet place by himself.

But the crowds heard about it and followed him on foot from the towns.

When Jesus saw the large crowd, he felt compassion for them and healed their sick.

As evening approached, the disciples came to him and said, "This is a remote place, and it's already getting late.

Send the crowds away so they can go to the villages and buy themselves some food."

Jesus replied, "They don't need to go away.

You give them something to eat."

They said, "We have only five loaves of bread and two fish."

Jesus said, "Bring them here to me."

He directed the people to sit down on the grass.

Taking the five loaves and the two fish and looking up to heaven, he gave thanks and broke the loaves.

Then he gave them to the disciples, and the disciples gave them to the people.

They all ate and were satisfied, and the disciples picked up twelve baskets full of leftover pieces.

The number of those who ate was about five thousand men, besides women and children.

Immediately, Jesus made the disciples get into the boat and go ahead of him to the other side while he dismissed the crowd.

After he had sent them away, he went up on a mountainside by himself to pray.

Later that night, he was there alone, and the boat was already a considerable distance from land, buffeted by the waves because the wind was against it.

Shortly before dawn, Jesus went out to them, walking on the lake.

When the disciples saw him walking on the lake, they were terrified.

"It's a ghost," they said, and cried out in fear.

But Jesus immediately said to them: "Take courage!

It is I.

Don't be afraid."

"Lord, if it's you," Peter replied, "tell me to come to you on the water."

"Come," he said.

Then Peter got down out of the boat, walked on the water, and came toward Jesus.

But when he saw the wind, he was afraid and, beginning to sink, cried out, "Lord, save me!"

Immediately Jesus reached out his hand and caught him.

"You of little faith," he said, "why did you doubt?"

And when they climbed into the boat, the wind died down.

Then those who were in the boat worshiped him, saying, "Truly you are the Son of God."

When they had crossed over, they landed at Gennesaret.

And when the men of that place recognized Jesus, they sent word to all the surrounding country.

People brought all their sick to him and begged him to let the sick just touch the edge of his cloak, and all who touched it were healed.

## Matthew 15

Then some Pharisees and teachers from Jerusalem came to Jesus and asked, "Why do your disciples break the tradition of the elders?

They don't wash their hands before they eat."

Jesus replied, "And why do you break God's command for the sake of your tradition?

God said, 'Honor your father and mother,' and 'Anyone who curses their father or mother is to be put to death.'

But you say that if anyone declares that what might have been used to help their parents is 'devoted to God,' they are not to honor their father or mother with it.

Thus you nullify the word of God for the sake of your tradition.

You hypocrites!

Isaiah was right when he prophesied about you: 'These people honor me with their lips, but their hearts are far from me.

They worship me in vain; their teachings are merely human rules.'"

Jesus called the crowd to him and said, "Listen and understand.

What goes into someone's mouth does not defile them, but what comes out of their mouth, that is what defiles them."

Then the disciples came to him and asked, "Do you know that the Pharisees were offended when they heard this?"

He replied, "Every plant that my heavenly Father has not planted will be pulled up by the roots.

Leave them; they are blind guides.

If the blind lead the blind, both will fall into a pit."

Peter said, "Explain the parable to us."

Jesus said, "Are you still so dull?

Don't you see that whatever enters the mouth goes into the stomach and then out of the body?

But the things that come out of a person's mouth come from the heart, and these defile them.

For out of the heart come evil thoughts--murder, adultery, sexual immorality, theft, false testimony, slander.

These are what defile a person; but eating with unwashed hands does not defile them."

Leaving that place, Jesus withdrew to the region of Tyre and Sidon.

A Canaanite woman from that vicinity came to him, crying out, "Lord, Son of David, have mercy on me!

My daughter is demon-possessed and suffering terribly."

Jesus did not answer a word.

So his disciples came to him and urged him, "Send her away, for she keeps crying out after us."

He answered, "I was sent only to the lost sheep of Israel."

The woman came and knelt before him.

"Lord, help me!" she said.

He replied, "It is not right to take the children's bread and toss it to the dogs."

"Yes it is, Lord," she said.

"Even the dogs eat the crumbs that fall from their master's table."

Then Jesus said to her, "Woman, you have great faith!

Your request is granted."

And her daughter was healed at that moment.

Jesus left there and went along the Sea of Galilee.

Then he went up on a mountainside and sat down.

Great crowds came to him, bringing the lame, the blind, the crippled, the mute, and many others, and laid them at his feet; and he healed them.

The people were amazed when they saw the mute speaking, the crippled made well, the lame walking, and the blind seeing.

And they praised the God of Israel.

Jesus called his disciples to him and said, "I have compassion for these people; they have already been with me three days and have nothing to eat.

I do not want to send them away hungry, or they may collapse on the way."

His disciples answered, "Where could we get enough bread in this remote place to feed such a crowd?"

Jesus asked, "How many loaves do you have?"

"Seven," they replied, "and a few small fish."

He told the crowd to sit down on the ground.

Then he took the seven loaves and the fish, and when he had given thanks, he broke them and gave them to the disciples, and they in turn to the people.

They all ate and were satisfied.

Afterward, the disciples picked up seven basketfuls of broken pieces that were left over.

The number of those who ate was four thousand men, besides women and children.

After Jesus had sent the crowd away, he got into the boat and went to the vicinity of Magadan.

## Matthew 16

The Pharisees and Sadducees came to test Jesus by asking him to show them a sign from heaven.

Jesus replied, "This wicked and unfaithful generation asks for a sign, but no sign will be given except the sign of Jonah."

Then he left them and went away.

When the disciples reached the other side, they realized they had forgotten to bring bread.

Jesus said to them, "Be careful and watch out for the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees."

The disciples discussed among themselves, thinking it was because they had not brought bread.

Aware of this, Jesus said, "Why are you talking about having no bread?

Do you still not understand?

Don't you remember the five loaves for the five thousand and how many baskets you gathered?

Or the seven loaves for the four thousand and how many baskets you gathered?

How is it you don't understand that I was not talking to you about bread?

But be on your guard against the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees.

Then they understood that he was not telling them to guard against the yeast used in bread, but against the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees.

When Jesus came to the region of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples, "Who do people say the Son of Man is?"

They replied, "Some say John the Baptist; others say Elijah; and still others, Jeremiah or one of the prophets."

"But what about you?" he asked.

"Who do you say I am?"

Simon Peter answered, "You are the Messiah, the Son of the living God."

Jesus replied, "Blessed are you, Simon son of Jonah, for this was not revealed to you by flesh and blood, but by my Father in heaven.

And I tell you that you are Peter, and on this rock I will build my church, and the gates of Hades will not overcome it.

I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven; whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven."

Then he ordered his disciples not to tell anyone that he was the Messiah.

From that time on, Jesus began to explain to his disciples that he must go to Jerusalem and suffer many things at the hands of the elders, the chief priests, and the teachers of the law, and that he must be killed and on the third day be raised to life.

Peter took him aside and began to rebuke him.

"Never, Lord!" he said.

"This shall never happen to you!"

Jesus turned and said to Peter, "Get behind me, Satan!

You are a stumbling block to me; you do not have in mind the concerns of God, but merely human concerns."

Then Jesus said to his disciples, "Whoever wants to be my disciple must deny themselves and take up their cross and follow me.

For whoever wants to save their life will lose it, but whoever loses their life for me will find it.

What good will it be for someone to gain the whole world, yet forfeit their soul?

Or what can anyone give in exchange for their soul?

For the Son of Man is going to come in his Father's glory with his angels, and then he will reward each person according to what they have done.

Truly I tell you, some who are standing here will not taste death before they see the Son of Man coming in his kingdom.

## Matthew 17

After six days, Jesus took Peter, James, and John, his brother, and led them up a high mountain by themselves.

There, Jesus changed in front of them; his face shone like the sun, and his clothes became as white as light.

Suddenly, Moses and Elijah appeared and were talking with Jesus.

Peter said to Jesus, "Lord, it's good for us to be here.

If you want, I'll make three shelters: one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah."

While he was still speaking, a bright cloud covered them, and a voice from the cloud said, "This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased.

Listen to him!"

When the disciples heard this, they fell face down to the ground, terrified.

But Jesus came and touched them, saying, "Get up, don't be afraid."

When they looked up, they saw no one except Jesus.

As they were coming down the mountain, Jesus instructed them, "Don't tell anyone what you have seen until the Son of Man has been raised from the dead."

The disciples asked him, "Why do the teachers of the law say that Elijah must come first?"

Jesus replied, "Elijah does come and will restore all things.

But I tell you, Elijah has already come, and they did not recognize him, but did to him whatever they wanted.

In the same way, the Son of Man is going to suffer at their hands."

Then the disciples understood that he was talking to them about John the Baptist.

When they came to the crowd, a man approached Jesus and knelt before him, saying, "Lord, have mercy on my son.

He has seizures and is suffering greatly.

He often falls into the fire or into the water.

I brought him to your disciples, but they couldn't heal him."

Jesus replied, "You unbelieving and perverse generation, how long shall I stay with you?

How long shall I put up with you?

Bring the boy here to me."

Jesus rebuked the demon, and it came out of the boy, and he was healed at that moment.

Then the disciples came to Jesus in private and asked, "Why couldn't we drive it out?"

He replied, "Because you have so little faith.

Truly I tell you, if you have faith as small as a mustard seed, you can say to this mountain, 'Move from here to there,' and it will move.

Nothing will be impossible for you."

When they came together in Galilee, Jesus said to them, "The Son of Man is going to be delivered into the hands of men.

They will kill him, and on the third day he will be raised to life."

And the disciples were filled with grief.

When they arrived in Capernaum, the collectors of the two-drachma temple tax came to Peter and asked, "Doesn't your teacher pay the temple tax?"

"Yes, he does," he replied.

When Peter came into the house, Jesus was the first to speak.

"What do you think, Simon?

From whom do the kings of the earth collect duty and taxes--from their own children or from others?"

"From others," Peter answered.

"Then the children are exempt," Jesus said to him.

"But so that we may not cause offense, go to the lake and throw out your line.

Take the first fish you catch; open its mouth and you will find a four-drachma coin.

Take it and give it to them for my tax and yours."

## Matthew 18

At that time, the disciples came to Jesus and asked, "Who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven?"

Jesus called a child to him and placed the child among them.

He said, "Truly I tell you, unless you change and become like little children, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven.

Therefore, whoever takes the lowly position of this child is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven.

And whoever welcomes one such child in my name welcomes me.

But if anyone causes one of these little ones who believe in me to stumble, it would be better for them to have a large millstone hung around their neck and to be drowned in the depths of the sea.

Woe to the world because of the things that cause people to stumble!

Such things must come, but woe to the person through whom they come!

If your hand or your foot causes you to stumble, cut it off and throw it away.

It is better for you to enter life maimed or crippled than to have two hands or two feet and be thrown into eternal fire.

And if your eye causes you to stumble, gouge it out and throw it away.

It is better for you to enter life with one eye than to have two eyes and be thrown into the fire of hell.

See that you do not despise one of these little ones.

For I tell you that their angels in heaven always see the face of my Father in heaven.

What do you think?

If a man owns a hundred sheep, and one of them wanders away, will he not leave the ninety-nine on the hills and go to look for the one that wandered off?

And if he finds it, truly I tell you, he is happier about that one sheep than about the ninety-nine that did not wander off.

In the same way, your Father in heaven is not willing that any of these little ones should perish.

If your brother or sister sins, go and point out their fault, just between the two of you.

If they listen to you, you have won them over.

But if they will not listen, take one or two others along, so that 'every matter may be established by the testimony of two or three witnesses.'

If they still refuse to listen, tell it to the church; and if they refuse to listen even to the church, treat them as you would a pagan or a tax collector.

Truly I tell you, whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven.

Again, truly I tell you that if two of you on earth agree about anything they ask for, it will be done for them by my Father in heaven.

For where two or three gather in my name, there am I with them."

Then Peter came to Jesus and asked, "Lord, how many times shall I forgive my brother or sister who sins against me?

Up to seven times?"

Jesus answered, "I tell you, not seven times, but seventy-seven times.

Therefore, the kingdom of heaven is like a king who wanted to settle accounts with his servants.

As he began the settlement, a man who owed him ten thousand bags of gold was brought to him.

Since he was not able to pay, the master ordered that he and his wife and his children and all that he had be sold to repay the debt.

At this the servant fell on his knees before him.

'Be patient with me,' he begged, 'and I will pay back everything.'

The servant's master took pity on him, canceled the debt and let him go.

But when that servant went out, he found one of his fellow servants who owed him a hundred silver coins.

He grabbed him and began to choke him.

'Pay back what you owe me!' he demanded.

His fellow servant fell to his knees and begged him, 'Be patient with me, and I will pay it back.'

But he refused.

Instead, he went off and had the man thrown into prison until he could pay the debt.

When the other servants saw what had happened, they were outraged and went and told their master everything that had happened.

Then the master called the servant in.

'You wicked servant,' he said, 'I canceled all that debt of yours because you begged me to.

Shouldn't you have had mercy on your fellow servant just as I had on you?'

In anger his master handed him over to the jailers to be tortured, until he should pay back all he owed.

This is how my heavenly Father will treat each of you unless you forgive your brother or sister from your heart."

## Matthew 19

When Jesus finished speaking, he left Galilee and went to the region of Judea across the Jordan River.

Many people followed him, and he healed them there.

Some Pharisees came to test him, asking if it was lawful for a man to divorce his wife for any reason.

Jesus replied, "Haven't you read that at the beginning the Creator made them male and female, and said, 'For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and the two will become one flesh'?

So they are no longer two, but one flesh.

Therefore, what God has joined together, let no one separate."

They asked, "Why then did Moses command that a man give his wife a certificate of divorce and send her away?"

Jesus replied, "Moses allowed you to divorce your wives because your hearts were hard.

But it was not this way from the beginning.

I tell you that anyone who divorces his wife, except for sexual immorality, and marries another woman commits adultery."

His disciples said to him, "If this is the situation between a husband and wife, it is better not to marry."

Jesus replied, "Not everyone can accept this word, but only those to whom it has been given.

For there are eunuchs who were born that way, and there are eunuchs who have been made eunuchs by others, and there are those who choose to live like eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom of heaven.

The one who can accept this should accept it."

Then people brought little children to Jesus for him to place his hands on them and pray for them.

But the disciples rebuked them.

Jesus said, "Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of heaven belongs to such as these."

When he had placed his hands on them, he went on from there.

A man came up to Jesus and asked, "Teacher, what good thing must I do to get eternal life?"

Jesus replied, "Why do you ask me about what is good?

There is only One who is good.

If you want to enter life, keep the commandments."

"Which ones?" he inquired.

Jesus replied, "You shall not murder, you shall not commit adultery, you shall not steal, you shall not give false testimony, honor your father and mother, and love your neighbor as yourself."

"All these I have kept," the young man said.

"What do I still lack?"

Jesus answered, "If you want to be perfect, go, sell your possessions and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven.

Then come, follow me."

When the young man heard this, he went away sad, because he had great wealth.

Then Jesus said to his disciples, "Truly I tell you, it is hard for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of heaven.

Again I tell you, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of God."

When the disciples heard this, they were greatly astonished and asked, "Who then can be saved?"

Jesus looked at them and said, "With man this is impossible, but with God all things are possible."

Peter answered him, "We have left everything to follow you!

What then will there be for us?"

Jesus said to them, "Truly I tell you, at the renewal of all things, when the Son of Man sits on his glorious throne, you who have followed me will also sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.

And everyone who has left houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother or wife or children or fields for my sake will receive a hundred times as much and will inherit eternal life.

But many who are first will be last, and many who are last will be first."

## Matthew 20

The kingdom of heaven is like a landowner who went out early in the morning to hire workers for his vineyard.

He agreed to pay them a denarius for the day and sent them into his vineyard.

About nine in the morning, he went out and saw others standing in the marketplace doing nothing.

He told them, 'You also go and work in my vineyard, and I will pay you whatever is right.'

So they went.

He went out again about noon and three in the afternoon and did the same thing.

About five in the afternoon, he went out and found still others standing around.

He asked them, 'Why have you been standing here all day long doing nothing?'

'Because no one has hired us,' they answered.

He said to them, 'You also go and work in my vineyard.'

When evening came, the owner of the vineyard said to his foreman, 'Call the workers and pay them their wages, beginning with the last ones hired and going on to the first.'

The workers who were hired about five in the afternoon came and each received a denarius.

So when those came who were hired first, they expected to receive more.

But each one of them also received a denarius.

When they received it, they began to grumble against the landowner.

'These who were hired last worked only one hour,' they said, 'and you have made them equal to us who have borne the burden of the work and the heat of the day.'

But he answered one of them, 'I am not being unfair to you, friend.

Didn't you agree to work for a denarius?

Take your pay and go.

I want to give the one who was hired last the same as I gave you.

Don't I have the right to do what I want with my own money?

Or are you envious because I am generous?'

So the last will be first, and the first will be last.

Now Jesus was going up to Jerusalem.

On the way, he took the Twelve aside and said to them, 'We are going up to Jerusalem, and the Son of Man will be delivered over to the chief priests and the teachers of the law.

They will condemn him to death and will hand him over to the Gentiles to be mocked and flogged and crucified.

On the third day, he will be raised to life.'

Then the mother of Zebedee's sons came to Jesus with her sons and, kneeling down, asked a favor of him.

'What is it you want?' he asked.

She said, 'Grant that one of these two sons of mine may sit at your right and the other at your left in your kingdom.'

'You don't know what you are asking,' Jesus said to them.

'Can you drink the cup I am going to drink?'

'We can,' they answered.

Jesus said to them, 'You will indeed drink from my cup, but to sit at my right or left is not for me to grant.

These places belong to those for whom they have been prepared by my Father.'

When the ten heard about this, they were indignant with the two brothers.

Jesus called them together and said, 'You know that the rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and their high officials exercise authority over them.

Not so with you.

Instead, whoever wants to become great among you must be your servant, and whoever wants to be first must be your slave--just as the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many.'

As Jesus and his disciples were leaving Jericho, a large crowd followed him.

Two blind men were sitting by the roadside, and when they heard that Jesus was going by, they shouted, 'Lord, Son of David, have mercy on us!'

The crowd rebuked them and told them to be quiet, but they shouted all the louder, 'Lord, Son of David, have mercy on us!'

Jesus stopped and called them.

'What do you want me to do for you?' he asked.

'Lord,' they answered, 'we want our sight.'

Jesus had compassion on them and touched their eyes.

Immediately they received their sight and followed him.

## Matthew 21

When they got close to Jerusalem and came to Bethphage at the Mount of Olives, Jesus sent two disciples ahead.

He told them, "Go into the village ahead of you, and right away you'll find a donkey tied up with a colt beside her.

Untie them and bring them to me.

If anyone asks you why, say that the Lord needs them, and they will let them go immediately."

This happened to fulfill what the prophet said: "Tell the daughter of Zion, 'Look, your king is coming to you, gentle and riding on a donkey, on a colt, the foal of a donkey.'"

The disciples went and did as Jesus instructed.

They brought the donkey and the colt, placed their cloaks on them, and Jesus sat on them.

A large crowd spread their cloaks on the road, while others cut branches from the trees and spread them on the road.

The crowds that went ahead of him and those that followed shouted, "Hosanna to the Son of David! Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord! Hosanna in the highest heaven!"

When Jesus entered Jerusalem, the whole city was stirred and asked, "Who is this?"

The crowds answered, "This is Jesus, the prophet from Nazareth in Galilee."

Jesus entered the temple courts and drove out all who were buying and selling there.

He overturned the tables of the money changers and the benches of those selling doves.

He said to them, "It is written, 'My house will be called a house of prayer,' but you are making it a 'den of robbers.'"

The blind and the lame came to him at the temple, and he healed them.

But when the chief priests and the teachers of the law saw the wonderful things he did and the children shouting in the temple courts, "Hosanna to the Son of David," they were indignant.

"Do you hear what these children are saying?" they asked him.

"Yes," replied Jesus, "have you never read, 'From the lips of children and infants you, Lord, have called forth your praise'?"

And he left them and went out of the city to Bethany, where he spent the night.

Early in the morning, as Jesus was on his way back to the city, he was hungry.

Seeing a fig tree by the road, he went up to it but found nothing on it except leaves.

Then he said to it, "May you never bear fruit again!"

Immediately the tree withered.

When the disciples saw this, they were amazed.

"How did the fig tree wither so quickly?" they asked.

Jesus replied, "Truly I tell you, if you have faith and do not doubt, not only can you do what was done to the fig tree, but also you can say to this mountain, 'Go, throw yourself into the sea,' and it will be done.

If you believe, you will receive whatever you ask for in prayer."

Jesus entered the temple courts, and while he was teaching, the chief priests and the elders of the people came to him.

"By what authority are you doing these things?" they asked.

"And who gave you this authority?"

Jesus replied, "I will also ask you one question.

If you answer me, I will tell you by what authority I am doing these things.

John's baptism--where did it come from?

Was it from heaven, or of human origin?"

They discussed it among themselves and said, "If we say, 'From heaven,' he will ask, 'Then why didn't you believe him?'

But if we say, 'Of human origin,' we are afraid of the people, for they all hold that John was a prophet."

So they answered Jesus, "We don't know."

Then he said, "Neither will I tell you by what authority I am doing these things.

"What do you think?

There was a man who had two sons.

He went to the first and said, 'Son, go and work today in the vineyard.'

'I will not,' he answered, but later he changed his mind and went.

"Then the father went to the other son and said the same thing.

He answered, 'I will, sir,' but he did not go.

"Which of the two did what his father wanted?"

"The first," they answered.

Jesus said to them, "Truly I tell you, the tax collectors and the prostitutes are entering the kingdom of God ahead of you.

For John came to you to show you the way of righteousness, and you did not believe him, but the tax collectors and the prostitutes did.

And even after you saw this, you did not repent and believe him.

"Listen to another parable: There was a landowner who planted a vineyard.

He put a wall around it, dug a winepress in it, and built a watchtower.

Then he rented the vineyard to some farmers and moved to another place.

When the harvest time approached, he sent his servants to the tenants to collect his fruit.

"The tenants seized his servants; they beat one, killed another, and stoned a third.

Then he sent other servants to them, more than the first time, and the tenants treated them the same way.

Last of all, he sent his son to them.

'They will respect my son,' he said.

"But when the tenants saw the son, they said to each other, 'This is the heir.

Come, let's kill him and take his inheritance.'

So they took him and threw him out of the vineyard and killed him.

"Therefore, when the owner of the vineyard comes, what will he do to those tenants?"

"He will bring those wretches to a wretched end," they replied, "and he will rent the vineyard to other tenants, who will give him his share of the crop at harvest time."

Jesus said to them, "Have you never read in the Scriptures: 'The stone the builders rejected has become the cornerstone; the Lord has done this, and it is marvelous in our eyes'?

Therefore I tell you that the kingdom of God will be taken away from you and given to a people who will produce its fruit.

Anyone who falls on this stone will be broken to pieces; anyone on whom it falls will be crushed."

When the chief priests and the Pharisees heard Jesus' parables, they knew he was talking about them.

They looked for a way to arrest him, but they were afraid of the crowd because the people held that he was a prophet.

## Matthew 22

Jesus told them another story: "The kingdom of heaven is like a king who prepared a wedding feast for his son.

He sent his servants to invite the guests, but they didn't want to come.

So, he sent more servants to tell them, 'The feast is ready, the food is prepared, come to the wedding.'

But they ignored the invitation and went about their business.

Some even mistreated and killed the servants.

The king was angry and sent his army to destroy those murderers and burn their city.

Then he said to his servants, 'The wedding is ready, but those invited were not worthy.

Go to the streets and invite anyone you find.'

The servants did so and gathered all they could find, both good and bad, and the wedding hall was filled with guests.

But when the king came in to see the guests, he noticed a man not wearing wedding clothes.

He asked, 'Friend, how did you get in here without wedding clothes?'

The man was speechless.

Then the king told the attendants, 'Tie him hand and foot, and throw him outside into the darkness, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.'

For many are invited, but few are chosen."

Then the Pharisees plotted to trap Jesus with his words.

They sent their disciples with the Herodians to him, saying, "Teacher, we know you are truthful and teach God's way truthfully.

You don't care about anyone's opinion because you don't look at people's status.

Tell us, is it right to pay taxes to Caesar or not?"

Jesus, knowing their evil intent, said, "Why are you trying to trap me, you hypocrites?

Show me the coin used for the tax."

They brought him a denarius, and he asked, "Whose image and inscription is this?"

"Caesar's," they replied.

Then he said, "Give back to Caesar what is Caesar's, and to God what is God's."

They were amazed and left him.

That same day, the Sadducees, who say there is no resurrection, came to him with a question: "Teacher, Moses said if a man dies without children, his brother should marry the widow and have children for him.

There were seven brothers among us.

The first married and died without children, so his brother married the widow.

The same happened to the second and third brother, right down to the seventh.

Finally, the woman died.

Now then, at the resurrection, whose wife will she be of the seven, since all of them were married to her?"

Jesus replied, "You are mistaken because you do not know the Scriptures or the power of God.

At the resurrection, people will neither marry nor be given in marriage; they will be like the angels in heaven.

But about the resurrection of the dead--have you not read what God said to you, 'I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob'?

He is not the God of the dead but of the living."

When the crowds heard this, they were astonished at his teaching.

Hearing that Jesus had silenced the Sadducees, the Pharisees got together.

One of them, an expert in the law, tested him with this question: "Teacher, which is the greatest commandment in the Law?"

Jesus replied, "Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind.

This is the first and greatest commandment.

And the second is like it: Love your neighbor as yourself.

All the Law and the Prophets hang on these two commandments."

While the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus asked them, "What do you think about the Messiah? Whose son is he?"

"The son of David," they replied.

He said to them, "How is it then that David, speaking by the Spirit, calls him 'Lord'?

For he says, 'The Lord said to my Lord: "Sit at my right hand until I put your enemies under your feet."'

If then David calls him 'Lord,' how can he be his son?"

No one could say a word in reply, and from that day on no one dared to ask him any more questions.

## Matthew 23

Then Jesus spoke to the crowds and his disciples, saying, "The teachers of the law and the Pharisees sit in Moses' seat.

So you must be careful to do everything they tell you.

But do not do what they do, for they do not practice what they preach.

They tie up heavy, cumbersome loads and put them on other people's shoulders, but they themselves are not willing to lift a finger to move them.

Everything they do is done for people to see: They make their phylacteries wide and the tassels on their garments long; they love the place of honor at banquets and the most important seats in the synagogues; they love to be greeted with respect in the marketplaces and to be called 'Rabbi' by others.

But you are not to be called 'Rabbi,' for you have one Teacher, and you are all brothers.

And do not call anyone on earth 'father,' for you have one Father, and he is in heaven.

Nor are you to be called instructors, for you have one Instructor, the Messiah.

The greatest among you will be your servant.

For those who exalt themselves will be humbled, and those who humble themselves will be exalted.

Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites!

You shut the door of the kingdom of heaven in people's faces.

You yourselves do not enter, nor will you let those enter who are trying to.

Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites!

You travel over land and sea to win a single convert, and when you have succeeded, you make them twice as much a child of hell as you are.

Woe to you, blind guides!

You say, 'If anyone swears by the temple, it means nothing; but anyone who swears by the gold of the temple is bound by that oath.'

You blind fools!

Which is greater: the gold, or the temple that makes the gold sacred?

You also say, 'If anyone swears by the altar, it means nothing; but anyone who swears by the gift on the altar is bound by that oath.'

You blind men!

Which is greater: the gift, or the altar that makes the gift sacred?

Therefore, anyone who swears by the altar swears by it and by everything on it.

And anyone who swears by the temple swears by it and by the one who dwells in it.

And anyone who swears by heaven swears by God's throne and by the one who sits on it.

Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites!

You give a tenth of your spices--mint, dill, and cumin.

But you have neglected the more important matters of the law--justice, mercy, and faithfulness.

You should have practiced the latter, without neglecting the former.

You blind guides!

You strain out a gnat but swallow a camel.

Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites!

You clean the outside of the cup and dish, but inside they are full of greed and self-indulgence.

Blind Pharisee!

First clean the inside of the cup and dish, and then the outside also will be clean.

Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites!

You are like whitewashed tombs, which look beautiful on the outside but on the inside are full of the bones of the dead and everything unclean.

In the same way, on the outside you appear to people as righteous but on the inside you are full of hypocrisy and wickedness.

Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites!

You build tombs for the prophets and decorate the graves of the righteous.

And you say, 'If we had lived in the days of our ancestors, we would not have taken part with them in shedding the blood of the prophets.'

So you testify against yourselves that you are the descendants of those who murdered the prophets.

Go ahead, then, and complete what your ancestors started!

You snakes!

You brood of vipers!

How will you escape being condemned to hell?

Therefore I am sending you prophets and sages and teachers.

Some of them you will kill and crucify; others you will flog in your synagogues and pursue from town to town.

And so upon you will come all the righteous blood that has been shed on earth, from the blood of righteous Abel to the blood of Zechariah son of Berekiah, whom you murdered between the temple and the altar.

Truly I tell you, all this will come on this generation.

Jerusalem, Jerusalem, you who kill the prophets and stone those sent to you, how often I have longed to gather your children together, as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings, and you were not willing.

Look, your house is left to you desolate.

For I tell you, you will not see me again until you say, 'Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.'"

## Matthew 24

Jesus left the temple and was walking away when his disciples came up to him to show him the buildings of the temple.

He said to them, "Do you see all these things?

Truly I tell you, not one stone here will be left on another; every one will be thrown down."

As Jesus was sitting on the Mount of Olives, the disciples came to him privately.

"Tell us," they said, "when will this happen, and what will be the sign of your coming and of the end of the age?"

Jesus answered: "Watch out that no one deceives you.

For many will come in my name, claiming, 'I am the Messiah,' and will deceive many.

You will hear of wars and rumors of wars, but see to it that you are not alarmed.

Such things must happen, but the end is still to come.

Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom.

There will be famines and earthquakes in various places.

All these are the beginning of birth pains.

Then you will be handed over to be persecuted and put to death, and you will be hated by all nations because of me.

At that time many will turn away from the faith and will betray and hate each other, and many false prophets will appear and deceive many people.

Because of the increase of wickedness, the love of most will grow cold, but the one who stands firm to the end will be saved.

And this gospel of the kingdom will be preached in the whole world as a testimony to all nations, and then the end will come.

So when you see standing in the holy place 'the abomination that causes desolation,' spoken of through the prophet Daniel--let the reader understand--then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains.

Let no one on the housetop go down to take anything out of the house.

Let no one in the field go back to get their cloak.

How dreadful it will be in those days for pregnant women and nursing mothers!

Pray that your flight will not take place in winter or on the Sabbath.

For then there will be great distress, unequaled from the beginning of the world until now--and never to be equaled again.

If those days had not been cut short, no one would survive, but for the sake of the elect those days will be shortened.

At that time if anyone says to you, 'Look, here is the Messiah!' or, 'There he is!' do not believe it.

For false messiahs and false prophets will appear and perform great signs and wonders to deceive, if possible, even the elect.

See, I have told you ahead of time.

So if anyone tells you, 'There he is, out in the wilderness,' do not go out; or, 'Here he is, in the inner rooms,' do not believe it.

For as lightning that comes from the east is visible even in the west, so will be the coming of the Son of Man.

Wherever there is a carcass, there the vultures will gather.

Immediately after the distress of those days 'the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light; the stars will fall from the sky, and the heavenly bodies will be shaken.'

Then will appear the sign of the Son of Man in heaven.

And then all the peoples of the earth will mourn when they see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven, with power and great glory.

And he will send his angels with a loud trumpet call, and they will gather his elect from the four winds, from one end of the heavens to the other.

Now learn this lesson from the fig tree: As soon as its twigs get tender and its leaves come out, you know that summer is near.

Even so, when you see all these things, you know that it is near, right at the door.

Truly I tell you, this generation will certainly not pass away until all these things have happened.

Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will never pass away.

But about that day or hour no one knows, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father.

As it was in the days of Noah, so it will be at the coming of the Son of Man.

For in the days before the flood, people were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, up to the day Noah entered the ark; and they knew nothing about what would happen until the flood came and took them all away.

That is how it will be at the coming of the Son of Man.

Two men will be in the field; one will be taken and the other left.

Two women will be grinding with a hand mill; one will be taken and the other left.

Therefore keep watch, because you do not know on what day your Lord will come.

But understand this: If the owner of the house had known at what time of night the thief was coming, he would have kept watch and would not have let his house be broken into.

So you also must be ready, because the Son of Man will come at an hour when you do not expect him.

Who then is the faithful and wise servant, whom the master has put in charge of the servants in his household to give them their food at the proper time?

It will be good for that servant whose master finds him doing so when he returns.

Truly I tell you, he will put him in charge of all his possessions.

But suppose that servant is wicked and says to himself, 'My master is staying away a long time,' and he then begins to beat his fellow servants and to eat and drink with drunkards.

The master of that servant will come on a day when he does not expect him and at an hour he is not aware of.

He will cut him to pieces and assign him a place with the hypocrites, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.

## Matthew 25

The kingdom of heaven is like ten bridesmaids who took their lamps and went to meet the groom.

Five of them were foolish and five were wise.

The foolish ones took their lamps but didn't bring any extra oil, while the wise ones brought oil in jars along with their lamps.

The groom was delayed, so they all became drowsy and fell asleep.

At midnight, there was a shout: 'Here is the groom! Come out to meet him!'

All the bridesmaids woke up and prepared their lamps.

The foolish ones said to the wise, 'Give us some of your oil; our lamps are going out.'

But the wise replied, 'No, there may not be enough for both us and you.

Instead, go to those who sell oil and buy some for yourselves.'

While they were on their way to buy the oil, the groom arrived.

The bridesmaids who were ready went in with him to the wedding banquet, and the door was shut.

Later, the other bridesmaids also came.

'Lord, Lord,' they said, 'open the door for us!'

But he replied, 'Truly I tell you, I don't know you.'

Therefore keep watch, because you do not know the day or the hour.

It is like a man going on a journey, who called his servants and entrusted his wealth to them.

To one he gave five bags of gold, to another two bags, and to another one bag, each according to his ability.

Then he went on his journey.

The man who had received five bags of gold went at once and put his money to work and gained five more bags.

So also, the one with two bags of gold gained two more.

But the man who had received one bag went off, dug a hole in the ground, and hid his master's money.

After a long time, the master of those servants returned and settled accounts with them.

The man who had received five bags of gold brought the other five.

'Master,' he said, 'you entrusted me with five bags of gold.

See, I have gained five more.'

His master replied, 'Well done, good and faithful servant!

You have been faithful with a few things; I will put you in charge of many things.

Come and share your master's happiness!'

The man with two bags of gold also came.

'Master,' he said, 'you entrusted me with two bags of gold; see, I have gained two more.'

His master replied, 'Well done, good and faithful servant!

You have been faithful with a few things; I will put you in charge of many things.

Come and share your master's happiness!'

Then the man who had received one bag of gold came.

'Master,' he said, 'I knew that you are a hard man, harvesting where you have not sown and gathering where you have not scattered seed.

So I was afraid and went out and hid your gold in the ground.

See, here is what belongs to you.'

His master replied, 'You wicked, lazy servant!

So you knew that I harvest where I have not sown and gather where I have not scattered seed?

Well then, you should have put my money on deposit with the bankers, so that when I returned I would have received it back with interest.

So take the bag of gold from him and give it to the one who has ten bags.

For whoever has will be given more, and they will have an abundance.

Whoever does not have, even what they have will be taken from them.

And throw that worthless servant outside, into the darkness, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.

When the Son of Man comes in his glory, and all the angels with him, he will sit on his glorious throne.

All the nations will be gathered before him, and he will separate the people one from another as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats.

He will put the sheep on his right and the goats on his left.

Then the King will say to those on his right, 'Come, you who are blessed by my Father; take your inheritance, the kingdom prepared for you since the creation of the world.

For I was hungry and you gave me something to eat, I was thirsty and you gave me something to drink, I was a stranger and you invited me in, I needed clothes and you clothed me, I was sick and you looked after me, I was in prison and you came to visit me.'

Then the righteous will answer him, 'Lord, when did we see you hungry and feed you, or thirsty and give you something to drink?

When did we see you a stranger and invite you in, or needing clothes and clothe you?

When did we see you sick or in prison and go to visit you?'

The King will reply, 'Truly I tell you, whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers and sisters of mine, you did for me.'

Then he will say to those on his left, 'Depart from me, you who are cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels.

For I was hungry and you gave me nothing to eat, I was thirsty and you gave me nothing to drink, I was a stranger and you did not invite me in, I needed clothes and you did not clothe me, I was sick and in prison and you did not look after me.'

They also will answer, 'Lord, when did we see you hungry or thirsty or a stranger or needing clothes or sick or in prison, and did not help you?'

He will reply, 'Truly I tell you, whatever you did not do for one of the least of these, you did not do for me.'

Then they will go away to eternal punishment, but the righteous to eternal life.

## Matthew 26

When Jesus finished speaking, he told his disciples, "You know that in two days it will be Passover, and the Son of Man will be handed over to be crucified."

Then the chief priests and the elders of the people gathered in the courtyard of the high priest named Caiaphas.

They plotted to arrest Jesus secretly and kill him.

But they said, "Not during the festival, or there may be a riot among the people."

While Jesus was in Bethany at the house of Simon the leper, a woman came to him with an expensive jar of perfume and poured it on his head as he was reclining at the table.

When the disciples saw this, they were upset and said, "Why this waste?

This perfume could have been sold for a lot of money and given to the poor."

Aware of this, Jesus said to them, "Why are you bothering this woman?

She has done a beautiful thing for me.

You will always have the poor with you, but you will not always have me.

By pouring this perfume on my body, she has prepared me for burial.

Truly I tell you, wherever this gospel is preached throughout the world, what she has done will also be told in memory of her."

Then one of the Twelve, called Judas Iscariot, went to the chief priests and asked, "What are you willing to give me if I deliver him to you?"

So they counted out thirty pieces of silver for him.

From then on, Judas watched for an opportunity to hand Jesus over.

On the first day of the Festival of Unleavened Bread, the disciples came to Jesus and asked, "Where do you want us to make preparations for you to eat the Passover?"

He replied, "Go into the city to a certain man and tell him, 'The Teacher says: My appointed time is near.

I am going to celebrate the Passover with my disciples at your house.'"

So the disciples did as Jesus had directed them and prepared the Passover.

When evening came, Jesus was reclining at the table with the Twelve.

And while they were eating, he said, "Truly I tell you, one of you will betray me."

They were very sad and began to say to him one after the other, "Surely you don't mean me, Lord?"

Jesus replied, "The one who has dipped his hand into the bowl with me will betray me.

The Son of Man will go just as it is written about him.

But woe to that man who betrays the Son of Man!

It would be better for him if he had not been born."

Then Judas, the one who would betray him, said, "Surely you don't mean me, Rabbi?"

Jesus answered, "You have said so."

While they were eating, Jesus took bread, and when he had given thanks, he broke it and gave it to his disciples, saying, "Take and eat; this is my body."

Then he took a cup, and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, saying, "Drink from it, all of you.

This is my blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins.

I tell you, I will not drink from this fruit of the vine from now on until that day when I drink it new with you in my Father's kingdom."

When they had sung a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives.

Then Jesus told them, "This very night you will all fall away on account of me, for it is written: 'I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock will be scattered.'

But after I have risen, I will go ahead of you into Galilee."

Peter replied, "Even if all fall away on account of you, I never will."

"Truly I tell you," Jesus answered, "this very night, before the rooster crows, you will disown me three times."

But Peter declared, "Even if I have to die with you, I will never disown you."

And all the other disciples said the same.

Then Jesus went with his disciples to a place called Gethsemane, and he said to them, "Sit here while I go over there and pray."

He took Peter and the two sons of Zebedee along with him, and he began to be sorrowful and troubled.

Then he said to them, "My soul is overwhelmed with sorrow to the point of death.

Stay here and keep watch with me."

Going a little farther, he fell with his face to the ground and prayed, "My Father, if it is possible, may this cup be taken from me.

Yet not as I will, but as you will."

Then he returned to his disciples and found them sleeping.

"Couldn't you men keep watch with me for one hour?" he asked Peter.

"Watch and pray so that you will not fall into temptation.

The spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak."

He went away a second time and prayed, "My Father, if it is not possible for this cup to be taken away unless I drink it, may your will be done."

When he came back, he again found them sleeping, because their eyes were heavy.

So he left them and went away once more and prayed the third time, saying the same thing.

Then he returned to the disciples and said to them, "Are you still sleeping and resting?

Look, the hour has come, and the Son of Man is delivered into the hands of sinners.

Rise, let us go!

Here comes my betrayer!"

While he was still speaking, Judas, one of the Twelve, arrived.

With him was a large crowd armed with swords and clubs, sent from the chief priests and the elders of the people.

Now the betrayer had arranged a signal with them: "The one I kiss is the man; arrest him."

Going at once to Jesus, Judas said, "Greetings, Rabbi!" and kissed him.

Jesus replied, "Do what you came for, friend."

Then the men stepped forward, seized Jesus, and arrested him.

With that, one of Jesus' companions reached for his sword, drew it out, and struck the servant of the high priest, cutting off his ear.

"Put your sword back in its place," Jesus said to him, "for all who draw the sword will die by the sword.

Do you think I cannot call on my Father, and he will at once put at my disposal more than twelve legions of angels?

But how then would the Scriptures be fulfilled that say it must happen in this way?"

In that hour Jesus said to the crowd, "Am I leading a rebellion, that you have come out with swords and clubs to capture me?

Every day I sat in the temple courts teaching, and you did not arrest me.

But this has all taken place that the writings of the prophets might be fulfilled."

Then all the disciples deserted him and fled.

Those who had arrested Jesus took him to Caiaphas, the high priest, where the teachers of the law and the elders had assembled.

But Peter followed him at a distance, right up to the courtyard of the high priest.

He entered and sat down with the guards to see the outcome.

The chief priests and the whole Sanhedrin were looking for false evidence against Jesus so that they could put him to death.

But they did not find any, though many false witnesses came forward.

Finally, two came forward and declared, "This fellow said, 'I am able to destroy the temple of God and rebuild it in three days.'"

Then the high priest stood up and said to Jesus, "Are you not going to answer?

What is this testimony that these men are bringing against you?"

But Jesus remained silent.

The high priest said to him, "I charge you under oath by the living God: Tell us if you are the Messiah, the Son of God."

"You have said so," Jesus replied.

"But I say to all of you: From now on you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Mighty One and coming on the clouds of heaven."

Then the high priest tore his clothes and said, "He has spoken blasphemy!

Why do we need any more witnesses?

Look, now you have heard the blasphemy.

What do you think?"

"He is worthy of death," they answered.

Then they spit in his face and struck him with their fists.

Others slapped him and said, "Prophesy to us, Messiah.

Who hit you?"

Now Peter was sitting out in the courtyard, and a servant girl came to him.

"You also were with Jesus of Galilee," she said.

But he denied it before them all.

"I don't know what you're talking about," he said.

Then he went out to the gateway, where another servant girl saw him and said to the people there, "This fellow was with Jesus of Nazareth."

He denied it again, with an oath: "I don't know the man!"

After a little while, those standing there went up to Peter and said, "Surely you are one of them; your accent gives you away."

Then he began to call down curses, and he swore to them, "I don't know the man!"

Immediately a rooster crowed.

Then Peter remembered the word Jesus had spoken: "Before the rooster crows, you will disown me three times."

And he went outside and wept bitterly.

## Matthew 27

In the morning, all the chief priests and elders of the people decided to put Jesus to death.

They tied him up, took him away, and handed him over to Pilate, the governor.

When Judas, who had betrayed Jesus, saw that Jesus was condemned, he felt sorry and returned the thirty silver coins to the chief priests and elders, saying, "I have sinned by betraying innocent blood."

They replied, "What is that to us? That's your responsibility."

So Judas threw the money into the temple and left.

Then he went away and hanged himself.

The chief priests picked up the coins and said, "It is against the law to put this into the treasury, since it is blood money."

So they decided to use the money to buy the potter's field as a burial place for foreigners.

That is why it has been called the Field of Blood to this day.

Then what was spoken by Jeremiah the prophet was fulfilled: "They took the thirty silver coins, the price set on him by the people of Israel, and they used them to buy the potter's field, as the Lord commanded me."

Meanwhile, Jesus stood before the governor, and the governor asked him, "Are you the king of the Jews?"

Jesus replied, "You have said so."

When he was accused by the chief priests and the elders, he gave no answer.

Then Pilate asked him, "Don't you hear the testimony they are bringing against you?"

But Jesus made no reply, not even to a single charge--to the great amazement of the governor.

Now it was the governor's custom at the festival to release a prisoner chosen by the crowd.

At that time they had a well-known prisoner whose name was Barabbas.

So when the crowd had gathered, Pilate asked them, "Which one do you want me to release to you: Barabbas, or Jesus who is called the Messiah?"

For he knew it was out of self-interest that they had handed Jesus over to him.

While Pilate was sitting on the judge's seat, his wife sent him this message: "Don't have anything to do with that innocent man, for I have suffered a great deal today in a dream because of him."

But the chief priests and the elders persuaded the crowd to ask for Barabbas and to have Jesus executed.

"Which of the two do you want me to release to you?" asked the governor.

"Barabbas," they answered.

"What shall I do, then, with Jesus who is called the Messiah?" Pilate asked.

They all answered, "Crucify him!"

"Why? What crime has he committed?" asked Pilate.

But they shouted all the louder, "Crucify him!"

When Pilate saw that he was getting nowhere, but that instead an uproar was starting, he took water and washed his hands in front of the crowd.

"I am innocent of this man's blood," he said. "It is your responsibility!"

All the people answered, "His blood is on us and on our children!"

Then he released Barabbas to them.

But he had Jesus flogged, and handed him over to be crucified.

Then the governor's soldiers took Jesus into the Praetorium and gathered the whole company of soldiers around him.

They stripped him and put a scarlet robe on him, and then twisted together a crown of thorns and set it on his head.

They put a staff in his right hand.

Then they knelt in front of him and mocked him.

"Hail, king of the Jews!" they said.

They spit on him, and took the staff and struck him on the head again and again.

After they had mocked him, they took off the robe and put his own clothes on him.

Then they led him away to crucify him.

As they were going out, they met a man from Cyrene, named Simon, and they forced him to carry the cross.

They came to a place called Golgotha (which means "the place of the skull").

There they offered Jesus wine to drink, mixed with gall; but after tasting it, he refused to drink it.

When they had crucified him, they divided up his clothes by casting lots.

And sitting down, they kept watch over him there.

Above his head they placed the written charge against him: THIS IS JESUS, THE KING OF THE JEWS.

Two rebels were crucified with him, one on his right and one on his left.

Those who passed by hurled insults at him, shaking their heads and saying, "You who are going to destroy the temple and build it in three days, save yourself! Come down from the cross, if you are the Son of God!"

In the same way the chief priests, the teachers of the law and the elders mocked him.

"He saved others," they said, "but he can't save himself!

He's the king of Israel!

Let him come down now from the cross, and we will believe in him.

He trusts in God.

Let God rescue him now if he wants him, for he said, 'I am the Son of God.'"

In the same way the rebels who were crucified with him also heaped insults on him.

From noon until three in the afternoon darkness came over all the land.

About three in the afternoon Jesus cried out in a loud voice, "Eli, Eli, lema sabachthani?" (which means "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?")

When some of those standing there heard this, they said, "He's calling Elijah."

Immediately one of them ran and got a sponge.

He filled it with wine vinegar, put it on a staff, and offered it to Jesus to drink.

The rest said, "Now leave him alone.

Let's see if Elijah comes to save him."

And when Jesus had cried out again in a loud voice, he gave up his spirit.

At that moment the curtain of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom.

The earth shook, the rocks split and the tombs broke open.

The bodies of many holy people who had died were raised to life.

They came out of the tombs after Jesus' resurrection and went into the holy city and appeared to many people.

When the centurion and those with him who were guarding Jesus saw the earthquake and all that had happened, they were terrified, and exclaimed, "Surely he was the Son of God!"

Many women were there, watching from a distance.

They had followed Jesus from Galilee to care for his needs.

Among them were Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James and Joseph, and the mother of Zebedee's sons.

As evening approached, there came a rich man from Arimathea, named Joseph, who had himself become a disciple of Jesus.

Going to Pilate, he asked for Jesus' body, and Pilate ordered that it be given to him.

Joseph took the body, wrapped it in a clean linen cloth, and placed it in his own new tomb that he had cut out of the rock.

He rolled a big stone in front of the entrance to the tomb and went away.

Mary Magdalene and the other Mary were sitting there opposite the tomb.

The next day, the one after Preparation Day, the chief priests and the Pharisees went to Pilate.

"Sir," they said, "we remember that while he was still alive that deceiver said, 'After three days I will rise again.'

So give the order for the tomb to be made secure until the third day.

Otherwise, his disciples may come and steal the body and tell the people that he has been raised from the dead.

This last deception will be worse than the first."

"Take a guard," Pilate answered.

"Go, make the tomb as secure as you know how."

So they went and made the tomb secure by putting a seal on the stone and posting the guard.

## Matthew 28

Late on the Sabbath, as the first day of the week was dawning, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary went to see the tomb.

Suddenly, there was a great earthquake, for an angel of the Lord came down from heaven, rolled back the stone, and sat on it.

His appearance was like lightning, and his clothes were white as snow.

The guards were so afraid of him that they shook and became like dead men.

The angel said to the women, "Do not be afraid, for I know you are looking for Jesus, who was crucified.

He is not here; he has risen, just as he said.

Come and see the place where he lay.

Then go quickly and tell his disciples that he has risen from the dead and is going ahead of you into Galilee.

There you will see him.

Now I have told you."

So the women hurried away from the tomb, afraid yet filled with joy, and ran to tell his disciples.

Suddenly, Jesus met them and said, "Greetings."

They came to him, clasped his feet, and worshiped him.

Then Jesus said to them, "Do not be afraid.

Go and tell my brothers to go to Galilee; there they will see me."

While the women were on their way, some of the guards went into the city and reported to the chief priests everything that had happened.

When the chief priests had met with the elders and devised a plan, they gave the soldiers a large sum of money, telling them, "You are to say, 'His disciples came during the night and stole him away while we were asleep.'

If this report gets to the governor, we will satisfy him and keep you out of trouble."

So the soldiers took the money and did as they were instructed.

And this story has been widely circulated among the Jews to this very day.

Then the eleven disciples went to Galilee, to the mountain where Jesus had told them to go.

When they saw him, they worshiped him, but some doubted.

Then Jesus came to them and said, "All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me.

Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you.

And surely I am with you always, to the very end of the age."
