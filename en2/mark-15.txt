Early in the morning, the chief priests, elders, and scribes held a meeting with the whole council.
They tied up Jesus and took him to Pilate.
Pilate asked him, "Are you the King of the Jews?"
Jesus replied, "You say so."
The chief priests accused him of many things, but Jesus did not answer, which surprised Pilate.
During the festival, Pilate would release a prisoner chosen by the people.
There was a man named Barabbas, who was in prison with rebels who had committed murder.
The crowd asked Pilate to release a prisoner as usual.
Pilate asked, "Do you want me to release the King of the Jews?"
He knew the chief priests had handed Jesus over out of envy.
But the chief priests stirred up the crowd to ask for Barabbas instead.
Pilate asked, "What should I do with the one you call the King of the Jews?"
They shouted, "Crucify him!"
Pilate asked, "Why? What crime has he committed?"
But they shouted even louder, "Crucify him!"
Wanting to satisfy the crowd, Pilate released Barabbas and handed Jesus over to be crucified.
The soldiers took Jesus into the courtyard, called the Praetorium, and gathered the whole company of soldiers.
They dressed him in a purple robe, twisted a crown of thorns, and put it on his head.
They mocked him, saying, "Hail, King of the Jews!"
They hit him on the head with a staff, spit on him, and knelt in mock worship.
After mocking him, they took off the purple robe and put his own clothes back on him.
Then they led him out to crucify him.
They forced a man named Simon from Cyrene, who was coming in from the country, to carry Jesus' cross.
They brought Jesus to a place called Golgotha, which means "Place of the Skull."
They offered him wine mixed with myrrh, but he did not take it.
They crucified him and divided his clothes by casting lots to see what each would get.
It was nine in the morning when they crucified him.
The written charge against him read: THE KING OF THE JEWS.
They crucified two rebels with him, one on his right and one on his left.
Those who passed by hurled insults at him, shaking their heads and saying, "So! You who are going to destroy the temple and build it in three days, come down from the cross and save yourself!"
In the same way, the chief priests and teachers of the law mocked him among themselves, saying, "He saved others, but he can't save himself!
Let this Messiah, this King of Israel, come down now from the cross, that we may see and believe."
Those crucified with him also heaped insults on him.
At noon, darkness came over the whole land until three in the afternoon.
At three in the afternoon, Jesus cried out in a loud voice, "Eloi, Eloi, lema sabachthani?" (which means "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?")
Some of those standing near heard this and said, "Listen, he's calling Elijah."
Someone ran, filled a sponge with wine vinegar, put it on a staff, and offered it to Jesus to drink.
"Leave him alone. Let's see if Elijah comes to take him down," he said.
With a loud cry, Jesus breathed his last.
The curtain of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom.
And when the centurion, who stood there in front of Jesus, saw how he died, he said, "Surely this man was the Son of God!"
Some women were watching from a distance.
Among them were Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James the younger and of Joseph, and Salome.
In Galilee, these women had followed him and cared for his needs.
Many other women who had come up with him to Jerusalem were also there.
It was Preparation Day (that is, the day before the Sabbath).
So as evening approached, Joseph of Arimathea, a prominent member of the Council, who was himself waiting for the kingdom of God, went boldly to Pilate and asked for Jesus' body.
Pilate was surprised to hear that he was already dead.
Summoning the centurion, he asked him if Jesus had already died.
When he learned from the centurion that it was so, he gave the body to Joseph.
So Joseph bought some linen cloth, took down the body, wrapped it in the linen, and placed it in a tomb cut out of rock.
Then he rolled a stone against the entrance of the tomb.
Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joseph saw where he was laid.
