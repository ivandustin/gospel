## Matthew

This is the family history of Jesus Christ, who was a descendant of David and Abraham.

Abraham was the father of Isaac, Isaac was the father of Jacob, and Jacob was the father of Judah and his brothers.

Judah was the father of Perez and Zerah, whose mother was Tamar.

Perez was the father of Hezron, Hezron was the father of Ram, Ram was the father of Amminadab, Amminadab was the father of Nahshon, Nahshon was the father of Salmon, Salmon was the father of Boaz, whose mother was Rahab.

Boaz was the father of Obed, whose mother was Ruth.

Obed was the father of Jesse, and Jesse was the father of King David.

David was the father of Solomon, whose mother had been Uriah's wife.

Solomon was the father of Rehoboam, Rehoboam was the father of Abijah, Abijah was the father of Asa, Asa was the father of Jehoshaphat, Jehoshaphat was the father of Jehoram, Jehoram was the father of Uzziah, Uzziah was the father of Jotham, Jotham was the father of Ahaz, Ahaz was the father of Hezekiah, Hezekiah was the father of Manasseh, Manasseh was the father of Amon, Amon was the father of Josiah, and Josiah was the father of Jeconiah and his brothers at the time of the exile to Babylon.

After the exile to Babylon, Jeconiah was the father of Shealtiel, Shealtiel was the father of Zerubbabel, Zerubbabel was the father of Abiud, Abiud was the father of Eliakim, Eliakim was the father of Azor, Azor was the father of Zadok, Zadok was the father of Akim, Akim was the father of Elihud, Elihud was the father of Eleazar, Eleazar was the father of Matthan, Matthan was the father of Jacob, and Jacob was the father of Joseph, the husband of Mary, who gave birth to Jesus, who is called the Messiah.

So, there were fourteen generations from Abraham to David, fourteen from David to the exile to Babylon, and fourteen from the exile to the Messiah.

This is how the birth of Jesus the Messiah came about: His mother Mary was pledged to be married to Joseph, but before they came together, she was found to be pregnant through the Holy Spirit.

Because Joseph, her husband, was faithful to the law and did not want to expose her to public disgrace, he had in mind to divorce her quietly.

But after he had considered this, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream and said, "Joseph son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary home as your wife, because what is conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit.

She will give birth to a son, and you are to give him the name Jesus, because he will save his people from their sins."

All this took place to fulfill what the Lord had said through the prophet: "The virgin will conceive and give birth to a son, and they will call him Immanuel" (which means "God with us").

When Joseph woke up, he did what the angel of the Lord had commanded him and took Mary home as his wife.

But he did not consummate their marriage until she gave birth to a son.

And he gave him the name Jesus.

## Mark

The beginning of the good news about Jesus Christ, the Son of God, as it is written in the prophet Isaiah: "Look, I am sending my messenger ahead of you, who will prepare your way.

A voice of one calling in the wilderness, 'Prepare the way for the Lord, make straight paths for him.'"

John the Baptist appeared in the wilderness, preaching a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins.

People from all over Judea and Jerusalem went out to him, confessing their sins, and were baptized by him in the Jordan River.

John wore clothes made of camel's hair, with a leather belt around his waist, and he ate locusts and wild honey.

He preached, saying, "After me comes someone more powerful than I, whose sandals I am not worthy to untie.

I baptize you with water, but he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit."

At that time, Jesus came from Nazareth in Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan.

As Jesus was coming up out of the water, he saw heaven being torn open and the Spirit descending on him like a dove.

A voice came from heaven: "You are my Son, whom I love; with you I am well pleased."

Immediately, the Spirit sent him out into the wilderness, and he was in the wilderness for forty days, being tempted by Satan.

He was with the wild animals, and angels attended him.

After John was put in prison, Jesus went into Galilee, proclaiming the good news of God.

"The time has come," he said.

"The kingdom of God has come near.

Repent and believe the good news!"

As Jesus walked beside the Sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and his brother Andrew casting a net into the lake, for they were fishermen.

"Come, follow me," Jesus said, "and I will send you out to fish for people."

At once they left their nets and followed him.

When he had gone a little farther, he saw James son of Zebedee and his brother John in a boat, preparing their nets.

Without delay, he called them, and they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired men and followed him.

They went to Capernaum, and when the Sabbath came, Jesus went into the synagogue and began to teach.

The people were amazed at his teaching, because he taught them as one who had authority, not as the teachers of the law.

Just then a man in their synagogue who was possessed by an impure spirit cried out, "What do you want with us, Jesus of Nazareth?

Have you come to destroy us?

I know who you are--the Holy One of God!"

"Be quiet!" said Jesus sternly.

"Come out of him!"

The impure spirit shook the man violently and came out of him with a shriek.

The people were all so amazed that they asked each other, "What is this?

A new teaching--and with authority!

He even gives orders to impure spirits and they obey him."

News about him spread quickly over the whole region of Galilee.

As soon as they left the synagogue, they went with James and John to the home of Simon and Andrew.

Simon's mother-in-law was in bed with a fever, and they immediately told Jesus about her.

So he went to her, took her hand and helped her up.

The fever left her and she began to wait on them.

That evening after sunset, the people brought to Jesus all the sick and demon-possessed.

The whole town gathered at the door, and Jesus healed many who had various diseases.

He also drove out many demons, but he would not let the demons speak because they knew who he was.

Very early in the morning, while it was still dark, Jesus got up, left the house and went off to a solitary place, where he prayed.

Simon and his companions went to look for him, and when they found him, they exclaimed: "Everyone is looking for you!"

Jesus replied, "Let us go somewhere else--to the nearby villages--so I can preach there also.

That is why I have come."

So he traveled throughout Galilee, preaching in their synagogues and driving out demons.

A man with leprosy came to him and begged him on his knees, "If you are willing, you can make me clean."

Jesus was indignant.

He reached out his hand and touched the man.

"I am willing," he said.

"Be clean!"

Immediately the leprosy left him and he was cleansed.

Jesus sent him away at once with a strong warning: "See that you don't tell this to anyone.

But go, show yourself to the priest and offer the sacrifices that Moses commanded for your cleansing, as a testimony to them."

Instead he went out and began to talk freely, spreading the news.

As a result, Jesus could no longer enter a town openly but stayed outside in lonely places.

Yet the people still came to him from everywhere.

## Luke

Since many people have tried to write down the story of the things that have happened among us, just as those who were eyewitnesses and servants of the word from the beginning have passed them on to us, I too decided, after carefully investigating everything from the start, to write an orderly account for you, most excellent Theophilus, so that you may know the certainty of the things you have been taught.

In the days of Herod, king of Judea, there was a priest named Zechariah, from the division of Abijah, and his wife was from the daughters of Aaron, and her name was Elizabeth.

They were both righteous before God, living blamelessly according to all the commandments and regulations of the Lord.

But they had no child because Elizabeth was barren, and both were advanced in years.

While Zechariah was serving as a priest before God in the order of his division, it was his turn to enter the temple of the Lord and burn incense.

And the whole assembly of people was praying outside at the hour of incense.

Then an angel of the Lord appeared to him, standing at the right side of the altar of incense.

Zechariah was troubled when he saw him, and fear fell upon him.

But the angel said to him, "Do not be afraid, Zechariah, for your prayer has been heard, and your wife Elizabeth will bear you a son, and you shall call his name John.

You will have joy and gladness, and many will rejoice at his birth, for he will be great before the Lord.

He must not drink wine or strong drink, and he will be filled with the Holy Spirit even from his mother's womb.

He will turn many of the children of Israel to the Lord their God, and he will go before him in the spirit and power of Elijah, to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just, to make ready for the Lord a people prepared."

Zechariah said to the angel, "How shall I know this? For I am an old man, and my wife is advanced in years."

The angel answered him, "I am Gabriel.

I stand in the presence of God, and I was sent to speak to you and to bring you this good news.

And behold, you will be silent and unable to speak until the day that these things take place, because you did not believe my words, which will be fulfilled in their time."

The people were waiting for Zechariah, and they were wondering at his delay in the temple.

When he came out, he was unable to speak to them, and they realized that he had seen a vision in the temple.

He kept making signs to them and remained mute.

When his time of service was completed, he returned home.

After this, his wife Elizabeth became pregnant and for five months remained in seclusion.

"The Lord has done this for me," she said.

"In these days he has shown his favor and taken away my disgrace among the people."

In the sixth month, God sent the angel Gabriel to Nazareth, a town in Galilee, to a virgin pledged to be married to a man named Joseph, a descendant of David.

The virgin's name was Mary.

The angel went to her and said, "Greetings, you who are highly favored!

The Lord is with you."

Mary was greatly troubled at his words and wondered what kind of greeting this might be.

But the angel said to her, "Do not be afraid, Mary, you have found favor with God.

You will conceive and give birth to a son, and you are to call him Jesus.

He will be great and will be called the Son of the Most High.

The Lord God will give him the throne of his father David, and he will reign over Jacob's descendants forever; his kingdom will never end."

"How will this be," Mary asked the angel, "since I am a virgin?"

The angel answered, "The Holy Spirit will come on you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you.

So the holy one to be born will be called the Son of God.

Even Elizabeth your relative is going to have a child in her old age, and she who was said to be unable to conceive is in her sixth month.

For no word from God will ever fail."

"I am the Lord's servant," Mary answered.

"May your word to me be fulfilled."

Then the angel left her.

At that time Mary got ready and hurried to a town in the hill country of Judea, where she entered Zechariah's home and greeted Elizabeth.

When Elizabeth heard Mary's greeting, the baby leaped in her womb, and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit.

In a loud voice she exclaimed: "Blessed are you among women, and blessed is the child you will bear!

But why am I so favored, that the mother of my Lord should come to me?

As soon as the sound of your greeting reached my ears, the baby in my womb leaped for joy.

Blessed is she who has believed that the Lord would fulfill his promises to her!"

And Mary said: "My soul glorifies the Lord and my spirit rejoices in God my Savior, for he has been mindful of the humble state of his servant.

From now on all generations will call me blessed, for the Mighty One has done great things for me--holy is his name.

His mercy extends to those who fear him, from generation to generation.

He has performed mighty deeds with his arm; he has scattered those who are proud in their inmost thoughts.

He has brought down rulers from their thrones but has lifted up the humble.

He has filled the hungry with good things but has sent the rich away empty.

He has helped his servant Israel, remembering to be merciful to Abraham and his descendants forever, just as he promised our ancestors."

Mary stayed with Elizabeth for about three months and then returned home.

When it was time for Elizabeth to have her baby, she gave birth to a son.

Her neighbors and relatives heard that the Lord had shown her great mercy, and they shared her joy.

On the eighth day, they came to circumcise the child, and they were going to name him after his father Zechariah, but his mother spoke up and said, "No!

He is to be called John."

They said to her, "There is no one among your relatives who has that name."

Then they made signs to his father, to find out what he would like to name the child.

He asked for a writing tablet, and to everyone's astonishment, he wrote, "His name is John."

Immediately his mouth was opened and his tongue set free, and he began to speak, praising God.

All the neighbors were filled with awe, and throughout the hill country of Judea, people were talking about all these things.

Everyone who heard this wondered about it, asking, "What then is this child going to be?"

For the Lord's hand was with him.

His father Zechariah was filled with the Holy Spirit and prophesied: "Praise be to the Lord, the God of Israel, because he has come to his people and redeemed them.

He has raised up a horn of salvation for us in the house of his servant David (as he said through his holy prophets of long ago), salvation from our enemies and from the hand of all who hate us--to show mercy to our ancestors and to remember his holy covenant, the oath he swore to our father Abraham: to rescue us from the hand of our enemies, and to enable us to serve him without fear in holiness and righteousness before him all our days.

And you, my child, will be called a prophet of the Most High; for you will go on before the Lord to prepare the way for him, to give his people the knowledge of salvation through the forgiveness of their sins, because of the tender mercy of our God, by which the rising sun will come to us from heaven to shine on those living in darkness and in the shadow of death, to guide our feet into the path of peace."

And the child grew and became strong in spirit, and he lived in the wilderness until he appeared publicly to Israel.

## John

In the beginning, there was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.

He was with God in the beginning.

Everything was made through Him, and nothing was made without Him.

In Him was life, and that life was the light of all people.

The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness has not overcome it.

There was a man sent from God whose name was John.

He came as a witness to testify about the light, so that through him all might believe.

He himself was not the light; he came only as a witness to the light.

The true light that gives light to everyone was coming into the world.

He was in the world, and though the world was made through Him, the world did not recognize Him.

He came to His own, but His own did not receive Him.

Yet to all who did receive Him, to those who believed in His name, He gave the right to become children of God--children born not of natural descent, nor of human decision or a husband's will, but born of God.

The Word became flesh and made His dwelling among us.

We have seen His glory, the glory of the one and only Son, who came from the Father, full of grace and truth.

John testified about Him.

He cried out, saying, "This is the one I spoke about when I said, 'He who comes after me has surpassed me because He was before me.'"

From His fullness, we have all received grace upon grace.

For the law was given through Moses; grace and truth came through Jesus Christ.

No one has ever seen God, but the one and only Son, who is Himself God and is in closest relationship with the Father, has made Him known.

This was John's testimony when the Jewish leaders in Jerusalem sent priests and Levites to ask him who he was.

He did not fail to confess, but confessed freely, "I am not the Messiah."

They asked him, "Then who are you? Are you Elijah?"

He said, "I am not."

"Are you the Prophet?" He answered, "No."

Finally, they said, "Who are you? Give us an answer to take back to those who sent us. What do you say about yourself?"

John replied in the words of Isaiah the prophet, "I am the voice of one calling in the wilderness, 'Make straight the way for the Lord.'"

Now the Pharisees who had been sent questioned him, "Why then do you baptize if you are not the Messiah, nor Elijah, nor the Prophet?"

"I baptize with water," John replied, "but among you stands one you do not know.

He is the one who comes after me, the straps of whose sandals I am not worthy to untie."

This all happened at Bethany on the other side of the Jordan, where John was baptizing.

The next day John saw Jesus coming toward him and said, "Look, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world!

This is the one I meant when I said, 'A man who comes after me has surpassed me because He was before me.'

I myself did not know Him, but the reason I came baptizing with water was that He might be revealed to Israel."

Then John gave this testimony: "I saw the Spirit come down from heaven as a dove and remain on Him.

And I myself did not know Him, but the one who sent me to baptize with water told me, 'The man on whom you see the Spirit come down and remain is the one who will baptize with the Holy Spirit.'

I have seen and I testify that this is God's Chosen One."

The next day John was there again with two of his disciples.

When he saw Jesus passing by, he said, "Look, the Lamb of God!"

When the two disciples heard him say this, they followed Jesus.

Turning around, Jesus saw them following and asked, "What do you want?"

They said, "Rabbi" (which means "Teacher"), "where are you staying?"

"Come," He replied, "and you will see."

So they went and saw where He was staying, and they spent that day with Him.

It was about four in the afternoon.

Andrew, Simon Peter's brother, was one of the two who heard what John had said and who had followed Jesus.

The first thing Andrew did was to find his brother Simon and tell him, "We have found the Messiah" (that is, the Christ).

And he brought him to Jesus.

Jesus looked at him and said, "You are Simon son of John.

You will be called Cephas" (which, when translated, is Peter).

The next day Jesus decided to leave for Galilee.

Finding Philip, He said to him, "Follow me."

Philip, like Andrew and Peter, was from the town of Bethsaida.

Philip found Nathanael and told him, "We have found the one Moses wrote about in the Law, and about whom the prophets also wrote--Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph."

"Nazareth! Can anything good come from there?" Nathanael asked.

"Come and see," said Philip.

When Jesus saw Nathanael approaching, He said of him, "Here truly is an Israelite in whom there is no deceit."

"How do you know me?" Nathanael asked.

Jesus answered, "I saw you while you were still under the fig tree before Philip called you."

Then Nathanael declared, "Rabbi, you are the Son of God; you are the king of Israel."

Jesus said, "You believe because I told you I saw you under the fig tree.

You will see greater things than that."

He then added, "Very truly I tell you, you will see heaven open, and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of Man."
