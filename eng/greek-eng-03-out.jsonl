While Jesus was having dinner at Matthew's house, many tax collectors and sinners came and ate with him and his disciples. When the Pharisees saw this, they asked his disciples, \\\"Why does your teacher eat with tax collectors and sinners?\\\" On hearing this, Jesus said, \\\"It is not the healthy who need a doctor, but the sick.

The time will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them; then they will fast. No one sews a patch of unshrunk cloth on an old garment, for the patch will pull away from the garment, making the tear worse. Neither do people pour new wine into old wineskins. If they do, the skins will burst; the wine will run out and the wineskins will be ruined. No, they pour new wine into new wineskins, and both are preserved.\\\"\\n\\nWhile he was saying this, a synagogue leader came and knelt before him and said, \\\"My daughter has just died.

Yes, I tell you, and more than a prophet. This is the one about whom it is written: 'I will send my messenger ahead of you, who will prepare your way before you.' Truly I tell you, among those born of women there has not risen anyone greater than John the Baptist; yet whoever is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he. From the days of John the Baptist until now, the kingdom of heaven has been subjected to violence, and violent people have been raiding it. For all the Prophets and the Law prophesied until John.

He entered the house of God, and he and his companions ate the consecrated bread, which was not lawful for them to do, but only for the priests. Or haven't you read in the Law that on the Sabbath the priests in the temple desecrate the day and yet are innocent? I tell you that something greater than the temple is here. If you had known what these words mean, 'I desire mercy, not sacrifice,' you would not have condemned the innocent. For the Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath.\\\"\\n\\nThen Jesus went into their synagogue, and a man with a shriveled hand was there. Looking for a reason to accuse Jesus, they asked him, \\\"Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath?\\\" He said to them, \\\"If any of you has a sheep and it falls into a pit on the Sabbath, will you not take hold of it and lift it out? How much more valuable is a person than a sheep! Therefore it is lawful to do good on the Sabbath.\\\" Then he said to the man, \\\"Stretch out your hand.\\\" So he stretched it out and it was completely restored, just as sound as the other. But the Pharisees went out and plotted how they might kill Jesus.\\n\\nAware of this, Jesus withdrew from that place. A large crowd followed him, and he healed all who were ill. He warned them not to tell others about him. This was to fulfill what was spoken through the prophet Isaiah: \\\"Here is my servant whom I have chosen, the one I love, in whom I delight; I will put my Spirit on him, and he will proclaim justice to the nations. He will not quarrel or cry out; no one will hear his voice in the streets. A bruised reed he will not break, and a smoldering wick he will not snuff out, till he has brought justice through to victory. In his name the nations will put their hope.\\\"\\n\\nThen they brought him a demon-possessed man who was blind and mute, and Jesus healed him, so that he could both talk and see. All the people were astonished and said, \\\"Could this be the Son of David?\\\" But when the Pharisees heard this, they said, \\\"It is only by Beelzebul, the prince of demons, that this fellow drives out demons.\\\" Jesus knew their thoughts and said to them, \\\"Every kingdom divided against itself will be ruined, and every city or household divided against itself will not stand. If Satan drives out Satan, he is divided against himself. How then can his kingdom stand? And if I drive out demons by Beelzebul, by whom do your people drive them out? So then, they will be your judges. But if it is by the Spirit of God that I drive out demons, then the kingdom of God has come upon you.\\n\\nOr again, how can anyone enter a strong man's house and carry off his possessions unless he first ties up the strong man? Then he can plunder his house. Whoever is not with me is against me, and whoever does not gather with me scatters. And so I tell you, every kind of sin and slander can be forgiven, but blasphemy against the Spirit will not be forgiven. Anyone who speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven, but anyone who speaks against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven, either in this age or in the age to come.\\n\\nMake a tree good and its fruit will be good, or make a tree bad and its fruit will be bad, for a tree is recognized by its fruit. You brood of vipers, how can you who are evil say anything good? For the mouth speaks what the heart is full of. A good man brings good things out of the good stored up in him, and an evil man brings evil things out of the evil stored up in him. But I tell you that everyone will have to give account on the day of judgment for every empty word they have spoken. For by your words you will be acquitted, and by your words you will be condemned.\\\"\\n\\nThen some of the Pharisees and teachers of the law said to him, \\\"Teacher, we want to see a sign from you.\\\" He answered, \\\"A wicked and adulterous generation asks for a sign! But none will be given it except the sign of the prophet Jonah. For as Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of a huge fish, so the Son of Man will be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth. The men of Nineveh will stand up at the judgment with this generation and condemn it; for they repented at the preaching of Jonah, and now something greater than Jonah is here. The Queen of the South will rise at the judgment with this generation and condemn it; for she came from the ends of the earth to listen to Solomon's wisdom, and now something greater than Solomon is here.\\n\\nWhen an impure spirit comes out of a person, it goes through arid places seeking rest and does not find it. Then it says, 'I will return to the house I left.' When it arrives, it finds the house unoccupied, swept clean and put in order. Then it goes and takes with it seven other spirits more wicked than itself, and they go in and live there. And the final condition of that person is worse than the first. That is how it will be with this wicked generation.\\\"\\n\\nWhile Jesus was still talking to the crowd, his mother and brothers stood outside, wanting to speak to him.

Many people gathered around him, so he got into a boat and sat down while the crowd stood on the shore. He spoke to them in parables, saying, \\\"A farmer went out to sow seeds. As he was sowing, some seeds fell on the path, and birds came and ate them. Other seeds fell on rocky ground where there wasn't much soil, so they sprouted quickly but withered under the sun because they had no roots. Some seeds fell among thorns, and the thorns grew and choked them. But some seeds fell on good soil and produced a crop, some a hundredfold, some sixty, and some thirty. Whoever has ears, let them hear.\\\"\\n\\nThe disciples came to him and asked, \\\"Why do you speak to them in parables?\\\" He replied, \\\"Because the knowledge of the secrets of the kingdom of heaven has been given to you, but not to them. Whoever has will be given more, and they will have an abundance. Whoever does not have, even what they have will be taken from them. This is why I speak to them in parables: though seeing, they do not see; though hearing, they do not hear or understand. In them is fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah: 'You will be ever hearing but never understanding; you will be ever seeing but never perceiving.' For this people's heart has become calloused; they hardly hear with their ears, and they have closed their eyes. Otherwise, they might see with their eyes, hear with their ears, understand with their hearts, and turn, and I would heal them. But blessed are your eyes because they see, and your ears because they hear. Truly I tell you, many prophets and righteous people longed to see what you see but did not see it, and to hear what you hear but did not hear it.\\n\\n\\\"Listen then to what the parable of the sower means: When anyone hears the message about the kingdom and does not understand it, the evil one comes and snatches away what was sown in their heart. This is the seed sown along the path. The seed falling on rocky ground refers to someone who hears the word and at once receives it with joy. But since they have no root, they last only a short time. When trouble or persecution comes because of the word, they quickly fall away. The seed falling among the thorns refers to someone who hears the word, but the worries of this life and the deceitfulness of wealth choke the word, making it unfruitful. But the seed falling on good soil refers to someone who hears the word and understands it. This is the one who produces a crop, yielding a hundred, sixty, or thirty times what was sown.\\\"\\n\\nHe told them another parable: \\\"The kingdom of heaven is like a man who sowed good seed in his field. But while everyone was sleeping, his enemy came and sowed weeds among the wheat and went away. When the wheat sprouted and formed heads, then the weeds also appeared. The owner's servants came to him and said, 'Sir, didn't you sow good seed in your field? Where then did the weeds come from?' 'An enemy did this,' he replied. The servants asked him, 'Do you want us to go and pull them up?' 'No,' he answered, 'because while you are pulling the weeds, you may uproot the wheat with them. Let both grow together until the harvest. At that time, I will tell the harvesters: First collect the weeds and tie them in bundles to be burned; then gather the wheat and bring it into my barn.'\\\"\\n\\nHe told them another parable: \\\"The kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed, which a man took and planted in his field. Though it is the smallest of all seeds, yet when it grows, it is the largest of garden plants and becomes a tree, so that the birds come and perch in its branches.\\\"\\n\\nHe told them still another parable: \\\"The kingdom of heaven is like yeast that a woman took and mixed into about sixty pounds of flour until it worked all through the dough.\\\"\\n\\nJesus spoke all these things to the crowd in parables; he did not say anything to them without using a parable. So was fulfilled what was spoken through the prophet: \\\"I will open my mouth in parables, I will utter things hidden since the creation of the world.\\\"\\n\\nThen he left the crowd and went into the house. His disciples came to him and said, \\\"Explain to us the parable of the weeds in the field.\\\" He answered, \\\"The one who sowed the good seed is the Son of Man. The field is the world, and the good seed stands for the people of the kingdom. The weeds are the people of the evil one, and the enemy who sows them is the devil. The harvest is the end of the age, and the harvesters are angels. As the weeds are pulled up and burned in the fire, so it will be at the end of the age. The Son of Man will send out his angels, and they will weed out of his kingdom everything that causes sin and all who do evil. They will throw them into the blazing furnace, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth. Then the righteous will shine like the sun in the kingdom of their Father. Whoever has ears, let them hear.\\n\\n\\\"The kingdom of heaven is like treasure hidden in a field. When a man found it, he hid it again, and then in his joy went and sold all he had and bought that field. Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant looking for fine pearls. When he found one of great value, he went away and sold everything he had and bought it. Once again, the kingdom of heaven is like a net that was let down into the lake and caught all kinds of fish. When it was full, the fishermen pulled it up on the shore. Then they sat down and collected the good fish in baskets, but threw the bad away. This is how it will be at the end of the age. The angels will come and separate the wicked from the righteous and throw them into the blazing furnace, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.\\n\\n\\\"Have you understood all these things?\\\" Jesus asked. \\\"Yes,\\\" they replied. He said to them, \\\"Therefore every teacher of the law who has become a disciple in the kingdom of heaven is like the owner of a house who brings out of his storeroom new treasures as well as old.\\\"\\n\\nWhen Jesus had finished these parables, he moved on from there. Coming to his hometown, he began teaching the people in their synagogue, and they were amazed. \\\"Where did this man get this wisdom and these miraculous powers?\\\" they asked. \\\"Isn't this the carpenter's son? Isn't his mother's name Mary, and aren't his brothers James, Joseph, Simon, and Judas? Aren't all his sisters with us? Where then did this man get all these things?\\\" And they took offense at him.

Prompted by her mother, she said, \\\"Give me John the Baptist's head on a platter.\\\" The king was sad, but because of his promise and the guests, he ordered it to be done. He sent men to the prison to behead John, and they brought his head on a platter and gave it to the girl, who gave it to her mother.\\n\\nJohn's disciples came, took his body, and buried it. Then they went and told Jesus. When Jesus heard this, he left in a boat to a quiet place by himself. But the crowds heard about it and followed him on foot from the towns. When Jesus saw the large crowd, he felt compassion for them and healed their sick.\\n\\nAs evening approached, the disciples came to him and said, \\\"This is a remote place, and it's already getting late. Send the crowds away so they can go to the villages and buy themselves some food.\\\" Jesus replied, \\\"They don't need to go away. You give them something to eat.\\\" They said, \\\"We have only five loaves of bread and two fish.\\\" Jesus said, \\\"Bring them here to me.\\\" He directed the people to sit down on the grass. Taking the five loaves and the two fish and looking up to heaven, he gave thanks and broke the loaves. Then he gave them to the disciples, and the disciples gave them to the people. They all ate and were satisfied, and the disciples picked up twelve baskets full of leftover pieces. The number of those who ate was about five thousand men, besides women and children.\\n\\nImmediately, Jesus made the disciples get into the boat and go ahead of him to the other side while he dismissed the crowd. After he had sent them away, he went up on a mountainside by himself to pray. Later that night, he was there alone, and the boat was already a considerable distance from land, buffeted by the waves because the wind was against it.\\n\\nShortly before dawn, Jesus went out to them, walking on the lake. When the disciples saw him walking on the lake, they were terrified. \\\"It's a ghost,\\\" they said, and cried out in fear. But Jesus immediately said to them: \\\"Take courage! It is I. Don't be afraid.\\\" \\\"Lord, if it's you,\\\" Peter replied, \\\"tell me to come to you on the water.\\\" \\\"Come,\\\" he said. Then Peter got down out of the boat, walked on the water, and came toward Jesus. But when he saw the wind, he was afraid and, beginning to sink, cried out, \\\"Lord, save me!\\\" Immediately Jesus reached out his hand and caught him. \\\"You of little faith,\\\" he said, \\\"why did you doubt?\\\" And when they climbed into the boat, the wind died down. Then those who were in the boat worshiped him, saying, \\\"Truly you are the Son of God.\\\"\\n\\nWhen they had crossed over, they landed at Gennesaret. And when the men of that place recognized Jesus, they sent word to all the surrounding country. People brought all their sick to him and begged him to let the sick just touch the edge of his cloak, and all who touched it were healed.\"}", "refusal": null, "annotations": []}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2605, "completion_tokens": 812, "total_tokens": 3417, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}}, "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_6dd05565ef"}}, "error": null}

'Be patient with me,' he begged, 'and I will pay back everything.' The servant's master took pity on him, canceled the debt and let him go.

His fellow servant fell to his knees and begged him, 'Be patient with me, and I will pay it back.' But he refused. Instead, he went off and had the man thrown into prison until he could pay the debt.

But when the king came in to see the guests, he noticed a man not wearing wedding clothes. He asked, 'Friend, how did you get in here without wedding clothes?' The man was speechless.

There were seven brothers among us. The first married and died without children, so his brother married the widow. The same happened to the second and third brother, right down to the seventh. Finally, the woman died. Now then, at the resurrection, whose wife will she be of the seven, since all of them were married to her?\\\" Jesus replied, \\\"You are mistaken because you do not know the Scriptures or the power of God. At the resurrection, people will neither marry nor be given in marriage; they will be like the angels in heaven.

Which is greater: the gift, or the altar that makes the gift sacred? Therefore, anyone who swears by the altar swears by it and by everything on it.

For many will come in my name, claiming, 'I am the Messiah,' and will deceive many. You will hear of wars and rumors of wars, but see to it that you are not alarmed. Such things must happen, but the end is still to come. Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. There will be famines and earthquakes in various places. All these are the beginning of birth pains. Then you will be handed over to be persecuted and put to death, and you will be hated by all nations because of me. At that time many will turn away from the faith and will betray and hate each other, and many false prophets will appear and deceive many people. Because of the increase of wickedness, the love of most will grow cold, but the one who stands firm to the end will be saved. And this gospel of the kingdom will be preached in the whole world as a testimony to all nations, and then the end will come. So when you see standing in the holy place 'the abomination that causes desolation,' spoken of through the prophet Daniel\u2014let the reader understand\u2014then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains. Let no one on the housetop go down to take anything out of the house. Let no one in the field go back to get their cloak. How dreadful it will be in those days for pregnant women and nursing mothers! Pray that your flight will not take place in winter or on the Sabbath. For then there will be great distress, unequaled from the beginning of the world until now\u2014and never to be equaled again. If those days had not been cut short, no one would survive, but for the sake of the elect those days will be shortened. At that time if anyone says to you, 'Look, here is the Messiah!' or, 'There he is!' do not believe it. For false messiahs and false prophets will appear and perform great signs and wonders to deceive, if possible, even the elect. See, I have told you ahead of time. So if anyone tells you, 'There he is, out in the wilderness,' do not go out; or, 'Here he is, in the inner rooms,' do not believe it. For as lightning that comes from the east is visible even in the west, so will be the coming of the Son of Man. Wherever there is a carcass, there the vultures will gather. Immediately after the distress of those days 'the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light; the stars will fall from the sky, and the heavenly bodies will be shaken.' Then will appear the sign of the Son of Man in heaven. And then all the peoples of the earth will mourn when they see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven, with power and great glory. And he will send his angels with a loud trumpet call, and they will gather his elect from the four winds, from one end of the heavens to the other. Now learn this lesson from the fig tree: As soon as its twigs get tender and its leaves come out, you know that summer is near. Even so, when you see all these things, you know that it is near, right at the door. Truly I tell you, this generation will certainly not pass away until all these things have happened. Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will never pass away. But about that day or hour no one knows, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father. As it was in the days of Noah, so it will be at the coming of the Son of Man. For in the days before the flood, people were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, up to the day Noah entered the ark; and they knew nothing about what would happen until the flood came and took them all away. That is how it will be at the coming of the Son of Man. Two men will be in the field; one will be taken and the other left. Two women will be grinding with a hand mill; one will be taken and the other left. Therefore keep watch, because you do not know on what day your Lord will come. But understand this: If the owner of the house had known at what time of night the thief was coming, he would have kept watch and would not have let his house be broken into. So you also must be ready, because the Son of Man will come at an hour when you do not expect him. Who then is the faithful and wise servant, whom the master has put in charge of the servants in his household to give them their food at the proper time? It will be good for that servant whose master finds him doing so when he returns. Truly I tell you, he will put him in charge of all his possessions. But suppose that servant is wicked and says to himself, 'My master is staying away a long time,' and he then begins to beat his fellow servants and to eat and drink with drunkards. The master of that servant will come on a day when he does not expect him and at an hour he is not aware of. He will cut him to pieces and assign him a place with the hypocrites, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.\\\"\"}", "refusal": null, "annotations": []}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 3600, "completion_tokens": 1208, "total_tokens": 4808, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}}, "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_6dd05565ef"}}, "error": null}

They plotted to arrest Jesus secretly and kill him. But they said, \\\"Not during the festival, or there may be a riot among the people.\\\"\\n\\nWhile Jesus was in Bethany at the house of Simon the leper, a woman came to him with an expensive jar of perfume and poured it on his head as he was reclining at the table. When the disciples saw this, they were upset and said, \\\"Why this waste? This perfume could have been sold for a lot of money and given to the poor.\\\"\\n\\nAware of this, Jesus said to them, \\\"Why are you bothering this woman? She has done a beautiful thing for me. You will always have the poor with you, but you will not always have me. By pouring this perfume on my body, she has prepared me for burial. Truly I tell you, wherever this gospel is preached throughout the world, what she has done will also be told in memory of her.\\\"\\n\\nThen one of the Twelve, called Judas Iscariot, went to the chief priests and asked, \\\"What are you willing to give me if I deliver him to you?\\\" So they counted out thirty pieces of silver for him. From then on, Judas watched for an opportunity to hand Jesus over.\\n\\nOn the first day of the Festival of Unleavened Bread, the disciples came to Jesus and asked, \\\"Where do you want us to make preparations for you to eat the Passover?\\\" He replied, \\\"Go into the city to a certain man and tell him, 'The Teacher says: My appointed time is near. I am going to celebrate the Passover with my disciples at your house.'\\\" So the disciples did as Jesus had directed them and prepared the Passover.\\n\\nWhen evening came, Jesus was reclining at the table with the Twelve. And while they were eating, he said, \\\"Truly I tell you, one of you will betray me.\\\" They were very sad and began to say to him one after the other, \\\"Surely you don't mean me, Lord?\\\"\\n\\nJesus replied, \\\"The one who has dipped his hand into the bowl with me will betray me. The Son of Man will go just as it is written about him. But woe to that man who betrays the Son of Man! It would be better for him if he had not been born.\\\"\\n\\nThen Judas, the one who would betray him, said, \\\"Surely you don't mean me, Rabbi?\\\" Jesus answered, \\\"You have said so.\\\"\\n\\nWhile they were eating, Jesus took bread, and when he had given thanks, he broke it and gave it to his disciples, saying, \\\"Take and eat; this is my body.\\\" Then he took a cup, and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, saying, \\\"Drink from it, all of you. This is my blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins. I tell you, I will not drink from this fruit of the vine from now on until that day when I drink it new with you in my Father's kingdom.\\\"\\n\\nWhen they had sung a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives. Then Jesus told them, \\\"This very night you will all fall away on account of me, for it is written: 'I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock will be scattered.' But after I have risen, I will go ahead of you into Galilee.\\\"\\n\\nPeter replied, \\\"Even if all fall away on account of you, I never will.\\\" \\\"Truly I tell you,\\\" Jesus answered, \\\"this very night, before the rooster crows, you will disown me three times.\\\" But Peter declared, \\\"Even if I have to die with you, I will never disown you.\\\" And all the other disciples said the same.\\n\\nThen Jesus went with his disciples to a place called Gethsemane, and he said to them, \\\"Sit here while I go over there and pray.\\\" He took Peter and the two sons of Zebedee along with him, and he began to be sorrowful and troubled. Then he said to them, \\\"My soul is overwhelmed with sorrow to the point of death. Stay here and keep watch with me.\\\"\\n\\nGoing a little farther, he fell with his face to the ground and prayed, \\\"My Father, if it is possible, may this cup be taken from me. Yet not as I will, but as you will.\\\" Then he returned to his disciples and found them sleeping. \\\"Couldn't you men keep watch with me for one hour?\\\" he asked Peter. \\\"Watch and pray so that you will not fall into temptation. The spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak.\\\"\\n\\nHe went away a second time and prayed, \\\"My Father, if it is not possible for this cup to be taken away unless I drink it, may your will be done.\\\" When he came back, he again found them sleeping, because their eyes were heavy. So he left them and went away once more and prayed the third time, saying the same thing.\\n\\nThen he returned to the disciples and said to them, \\\"Are you still sleeping and resting? Look, the hour has come, and the Son of Man is delivered into the hands of sinners. Rise, let us go! Here comes my betrayer!\\\"\\n\\nWhile he was still speaking, Judas, one of the Twelve, arrived. With him was a large crowd armed with swords and clubs, sent from the chief priests and the elders of the people. Now the betrayer had arranged a signal with them: \\\"The one I kiss is the man; arrest him.\\\" Going at once to Jesus, Judas said, \\\"Greetings, Rabbi!\\\" and kissed him.\\n\\nJesus replied, \\\"Do what you came for, friend.\\\" Then the men stepped forward, seized Jesus, and arrested him. With that, one of Jesus' companions reached for his sword, drew it out, and struck the servant of the high priest, cutting off his ear.\\n\\n\\\"Put your sword back in its place,\\\" Jesus said to him, \\\"for all who draw the sword will die by the sword. Do you think I cannot call on my Father, and he will at once put at my disposal more than twelve legions of angels? But how then would the Scriptures be fulfilled that say it must happen in this way?\\\"\\n\\nIn that hour Jesus said to the crowd, \\\"Am I leading a rebellion, that you have come out with swords and clubs to capture me? Every day I sat in the temple courts teaching, and you did not arrest me. But this has all taken place that the writings of the prophets might be fulfilled.\\\" Then all the disciples deserted him and fled.\\n\\nThose who had arrested Jesus took him to Caiaphas, the high priest, where the teachers of the law and the elders had assembled. But Peter followed him at a distance, right up to the courtyard of the high priest. He entered and sat down with the guards to see the outcome.\\n\\nThe chief priests and the whole Sanhedrin were looking for false evidence against Jesus so that they could put him to death. But they did not find any, though many false witnesses came forward. Finally, two came forward and declared, \\\"This fellow said, 'I am able to destroy the temple of God and rebuild it in three days.'\\\"\\n\\nThen the high priest stood up and said to Jesus, \\\"Are you not going to answer? What is this testimony that these men are bringing against you?\\\" But Jesus remained silent.\\n\\nThe high priest said to him, \\\"I charge you under oath by the living God: Tell us if you are the Messiah, the Son of God.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You have said so,\\\" Jesus replied. \\\"But I say to all of you: From now on you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Mighty One and coming on the clouds of heaven.\\\"\\n\\nThen the high priest tore his clothes and said, \\\"He has spoken blasphemy! Why do we need any more witnesses? Look, now you have heard the blasphemy. What do you think?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"He is worthy of death,\\\" they answered.\\n\\nThen they spit in his face and struck him with their fists. Others slapped him and said, \\\"Prophesy to us, Messiah. Who hit you?\\\"\\n\\nNow Peter was sitting out in the courtyard, and a servant girl came to him. \\\"You also were with Jesus of Galilee,\\\" she said.\\n\\nBut he denied it before them all. \\\"I don't know what you're talking about,\\\" he said.\\n\\nThen he went out to the gateway, where another servant girl saw him and said to the people there, \\\"This fellow was with Jesus of Nazareth.\\\"\\n\\nHe denied it again, with an oath: \\\"I don't know the man!\\\"\\n\\nAfter a little while, those standing there went up to Peter and said, \\\"Surely you are one of them; your accent gives you away.\\\"\\n\\nThen he began to call down curses, and he swore to them, \\\"I don't know the man!\\\" Immediately a rooster crowed.\\n\\nThen Peter remembered the word Jesus had spoken: \\\"Before the rooster crows, you will disown me three times.\\\" And he went outside and wept bitterly.\"}", "refusal": null, "annotations": []}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 5655, "completion_tokens": 2025, "total_tokens": 7680, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}}, "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_6dd05565ef"}}, "error": null}

They tied him up, took him away, and handed him over to Pilate, the governor. When Judas, who had betrayed Jesus, saw that Jesus was condemned, he felt sorry and returned the thirty silver coins to the chief priests and elders, saying, \\\"I have sinned by betraying innocent blood.\\\" They replied, \\\"What is that to us? That's your responsibility.\\\" So Judas threw the money into the temple and left. Then he went away and hanged himself.\\n\\nThe chief priests picked up the coins and said, \\\"It is against the law to put this into the treasury, since it is blood money.\\\" So they decided to use the money to buy the potter's field as a burial place for foreigners. That is why it has been called the Field of Blood to this day.\\n\\nThen what was spoken by Jeremiah the prophet was fulfilled: \\\"They took the thirty silver coins, the price set on him by the people of Israel, and they used them to buy the potter's field, as the Lord commanded me.\\\"\\n\\nMeanwhile, Jesus stood before the governor, and the governor asked him, \\\"Are you the king of the Jews?\\\" Jesus replied, \\\"You have said so.\\\" When he was accused by the chief priests and the elders, he gave no answer. Then Pilate asked him, \\\"Don't you hear the testimony they are bringing against you?\\\" But Jesus made no reply, not even to a single charge\u2014to the great amazement of the governor.\\n\\nNow it was the governor's custom at the festival to release a prisoner chosen by the crowd. At that time they had a well-known prisoner whose name was Barabbas. So when the crowd had gathered, Pilate asked them, \\\"Which one do you want me to release to you: Barabbas, or Jesus who is called the Messiah?\\\" For he knew it was out of self-interest that they had handed Jesus over to him.\\n\\nWhile Pilate was sitting on the judge's seat, his wife sent him this message: \\\"Don't have anything to do with that innocent man, for I have suffered a great deal today in a dream because of him.\\\"\\n\\nBut the chief priests and the elders persuaded the crowd to ask for Barabbas and to have Jesus executed.\\n\\n\\\"Which of the two do you want me to release to you?\\\" asked the governor.\\n\\n\\\"Barabbas,\\\" they answered.\\n\\n\\\"What shall I do, then, with Jesus who is called the Messiah?\\\" Pilate asked.\\n\\nThey all answered, \\\"Crucify him!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Why? What crime has he committed?\\\" asked Pilate.\\n\\nBut they shouted all the louder, \\\"Crucify him!\\\"\\n\\nWhen Pilate saw that he was getting nowhere, but that instead an uproar was starting, he took water and washed his hands in front of the crowd. \\\"I am innocent of this man's blood,\\\" he said. \\\"It is your responsibility!\\\"\\n\\nAll the people answered, \\\"His blood is on us and on our children!\\\"\\n\\nThen he released Barabbas to them. But he had Jesus flogged, and handed him over to be crucified.\\n\\nThen the governor's soldiers took Jesus into the Praetorium and gathered the whole company of soldiers around him. They stripped him and put a scarlet robe on him, and then twisted together a crown of thorns and set it on his head. They put a staff in his right hand. Then they knelt in front of him and mocked him. \\\"Hail, king of the Jews!\\\" they said. They spit on him, and took the staff and struck him on the head again and again. After they had mocked him, they took off the robe and put his own clothes on him. Then they led him away to crucify him.\\n\\nAs they were going out, they met a man from Cyrene, named Simon, and they forced him to carry the cross. They came to a place called Golgotha (which means \\\"the place of the skull\\\"). There they offered Jesus wine to drink, mixed with gall; but after tasting it, he refused to drink it.\\n\\nWhen they had crucified him, they divided up his clothes by casting lots. And sitting down, they kept watch over him there. Above his head they placed the written charge against him: THIS IS JESUS, THE KING OF THE JEWS.\\n\\nTwo rebels were crucified with him, one on his right and one on his left. Those who passed by hurled insults at him, shaking their heads and saying, \\\"You who are going to destroy the temple and build it in three days, save yourself! Come down from the cross, if you are the Son of God!\\\"\\n\\nIn the same way the chief priests, the teachers of the law and the elders mocked him. \\\"He saved others,\\\" they said, \\\"but he can't save himself! He's the king of Israel! Let him come down now from the cross, and we will believe in him. He trusts in God. Let God rescue him now if he wants him, for he said, 'I am the Son of God.'\\\"\\n\\nIn the same way the rebels who were crucified with him also heaped insults on him.\\n\\nFrom noon until three in the afternoon darkness came over all the land. About three in the afternoon Jesus cried out in a loud voice, \\\"Eli, Eli, lema sabachthani?\\\" (which means \\\"My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?\\\")\\n\\nWhen some of those standing there heard this, they said, \\\"He's calling Elijah.\\\"\\n\\nImmediately one of them ran and got a sponge. He filled it with wine vinegar, put it on a staff, and offered it to Jesus to drink. The rest said, \\\"Now leave him alone. Let's see if Elijah comes to save him.\\\"\\n\\nAnd when Jesus had cried out again in a loud voice, he gave up his spirit.\\n\\nAt that moment the curtain of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom. The earth shook, the rocks split and the tombs broke open. The bodies of many holy people who had died were raised to life. They came out of the tombs after Jesus' resurrection and went into the holy city and appeared to many people.\\n\\nWhen the centurion and those with him who were guarding Jesus saw the earthquake and all that had happened, they were terrified, and exclaimed, \\\"Surely he was the Son of God!\\\"\\n\\nMany women were there, watching from a distance. They had followed Jesus from Galilee to care for his needs. Among them were Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James and Joseph, and the mother of Zebedee's sons.\\n\\nAs evening approached, there came a rich man from Arimathea, named Joseph, who had himself become a disciple of Jesus. Going to Pilate, he asked for Jesus' body, and Pilate ordered that it be given to him. Joseph took the body, wrapped it in a clean linen cloth, and placed it in his own new tomb that he had cut out of the rock. He rolled a big stone in front of the entrance to the tomb and went away. Mary Magdalene and the other Mary were sitting there opposite the tomb.\\n\\nThe next day, the one after Preparation Day, the chief priests and the Pharisees went to Pilate. \\\"Sir,\\\" they said, \\\"we remember that while he was still alive that deceiver said, 'After three days I will rise again.' So give the order for the tomb to be made secure until the third day. Otherwise, his disciples may come and steal the body and tell the people that he has been raised from the dead. This last deception will be worse than the first.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Take a guard,\\\" Pilate answered. \\\"Go, make the tomb as secure as you know how.\\\" So they went and made the tomb secure by putting a seal on the stone and posting the guard.\"}", "refusal": null, "annotations": []}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4846, "completion_tokens": 1702, "total_tokens": 6548, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}}, "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_6dd05565ef"}}, "error": null}

The guards were so afraid of him that they shook and became like dead men.\\n\\nThe angel said to the women, \\\"Do not be afraid, for I know you are looking for Jesus, who was crucified.
