One day, Jesus went to the house of a Pharisee leader to eat bread on the Sabbath, and people were watching him closely. A man with a disease was there in front of him. Jesus asked the legal experts and Pharisees, "Is it allowed to heal on the Sabbath or not?" They didn't answer, so Jesus healed the man and sent him away.

Then Jesus said to them, "If your son or an ox falls into a well on the Sabbath, wouldn't you immediately pull him out?" They couldn't reply to this.

Jesus also told a story to the guests about choosing the best seats. He said, "When you're invited to a wedding, don't sit in the best seat. Someone more important might be invited, and the host will ask you to move, and you'll be embarrassed. Instead, sit in the least important place, so the host might say, 'Friend, move up to a better place.' Then you'll be honored in front of everyone. For everyone who exalts themselves will be humbled, and those who humble themselves will be exalted."

He also told the host, "When you give a lunch or dinner, don't invite your friends, brothers, relatives, or rich neighbors, because they might invite you back, and you'll be repaid. Instead, invite the poor, the crippled, the lame, and the blind, and you'll be blessed because they can't repay you. You'll be repaid at the resurrection of the righteous."

Hearing this, one of the guests said, "Blessed is the one who will eat at the feast in the kingdom of God." Jesus replied, "A man was preparing a great banquet and invited many guests. When it was time for the banquet, he sent his servant to tell those invited, 'Come, everything is ready.' But they all began to make excuses. One said, 'I just bought a field and need to go see it. Please excuse me.' Another said, 'I just bought five pairs of oxen and am on my way to try them out. Please excuse me.' Another said, 'I just got married, so I can't come.'

The servant returned and reported this to his master. The owner of the house became angry and ordered his servant, 'Go out quickly into the streets and alleys of the town and bring in the poor, the crippled, the blind, and the lame.' The servant said, 'Sir, what you ordered has been done, but there is still room.' Then the master told his servant, 'Go out to the roads and country lanes and compel them to come in, so that my house will be full. I tell you, not one of those who were invited will get a taste of my banquet.'

Large crowds were traveling with Jesus, and he turned to them and said, "If anyone comes to me and does not hate their father and mother, wife and children, brothers and sisters—yes, even their own life—such a person cannot be my disciple. Whoever does not carry their cross and follow me cannot be my disciple.

Suppose one of you wants to build a tower. Won't you first sit down and estimate the cost to see if you have enough money to complete it? For if you lay the foundation and are not able to finish it, everyone who sees it will ridicule you, saying, 'This person began to build and wasn't able to finish.'

Or suppose a king is about to go to war against another king. Won't he first sit down and consider whether he is able with ten thousand men to oppose the one coming against him with twenty thousand? If he is not able, he will send a delegation while the other is still a long way off and will ask for terms of peace.

In the same way, those of you who do not give up everything you have cannot be my disciples.

Salt is good, but if it loses its saltiness, how can it be made salty again? It is fit neither for the soil nor for the manure pile; it is thrown out. Whoever has ears to hear, let them hear."
