In those days, John the Baptist came to the desert of Judea, telling people to change their ways because the kingdom of heaven was near. He was the one spoken about by the prophet Isaiah, who said, "A voice is calling in the desert, 'Prepare the way for the Lord, make straight paths for him.'" John wore clothes made of camel's hair and had a leather belt around his waist. His food was locusts and wild honey. People from Jerusalem, all of Judea, and the area around the Jordan River came to him. They confessed their sins and were baptized by him in the Jordan River.

When John saw many Pharisees and Sadducees coming to be baptized, he said to them, "You brood of vipers! Who warned you to escape the coming wrath? Produce fruit in keeping with repentance. And don't think you can say to yourselves, 'We have Abraham as our father.' I tell you that out of these stones God can raise up children for Abraham. The ax is already at the root of the trees, and every tree that does not produce good fruit will be cut down and thrown into the fire.

I baptize you with water for repentance. But after me comes someone more powerful than I, whose sandals I am not worthy to carry. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire. His winnowing fork is in his hand, and he will clear his threshing floor, gathering his wheat into the barn and burning up the chaff with unquenchable fire."

Then Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan to be baptized by John. But John tried to stop him, saying, "I need to be baptized by you, and you come to me?" Jesus replied, "Let it be so now; it is proper for us to do this to fulfill all righteousness." Then John agreed.

As soon as Jesus was baptized, he came up out of the water. At that moment, heaven was opened, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and landing on him. And a voice from heaven said, "This is my Son, whom I love; with him I am well pleased."
