When a huge crowd gathered, so many that they were stepping on each other, Jesus began to speak to his disciples. He warned them to be careful of the Pharisees' hypocrisy. He said that nothing hidden will stay hidden, and everything said in the dark will be heard in the light. He told them not to fear those who can kill the body but can't do anything more. Instead, they should fear God, who has the power to throw them into hell after death.

Jesus reassured them that God cares for them more than sparrows, and even the hairs on their heads are counted. He encouraged them to acknowledge him before others, and he would acknowledge them before God's angels. But those who deny him will be denied before the angels.

He also said that anyone who speaks against him will be forgiven, but blaspheming against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven. When they are brought before authorities, they shouldn't worry about what to say because the Holy Spirit will teach them what to say at that moment.

Someone in the crowd asked Jesus to tell his brother to share the inheritance with him. Jesus replied that he wasn't appointed as a judge over them. He warned them to be on guard against greed because life isn't about having lots of possessions.

He told a parable about a rich man whose land produced a lot. The man decided to tear down his barns and build bigger ones to store all his grain and goods. He thought he could relax and enjoy life, but God told him that he would die that night, and then who would get what he had prepared?

Jesus told his disciples not to worry about their lives, what they would eat, or what they would wear. Life is more than food, and the body is more than clothes. He pointed out that God feeds the ravens and clothes the lilies, so they shouldn't worry because they are more valuable than birds.

He encouraged them to seek God's kingdom, and everything else would be given to them. He told them to sell their possessions and give to the poor, storing up treasure in heaven where it can't be stolen or destroyed.

He advised them to be ready and watchful, like servants waiting for their master to return from a wedding banquet. Blessed are those servants whom the master finds watching when he comes.

Jesus said he came to bring fire on the earth and wished it were already kindled. He spoke of a baptism he had to undergo and how he was distressed until it was completed. He said he didn't come to bring peace but division, with families divided against each other.

He criticized the crowd for being able to interpret the weather but not understanding the present time. He urged them to settle matters quickly with their adversary before they are taken to court, or they might be thrown into prison until they pay the last penny.
