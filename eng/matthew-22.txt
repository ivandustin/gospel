Jesus told them another story: "The kingdom of heaven is like a king who prepared a wedding feast for his son. He sent his servants to invite the guests, but they didn't want to come. So, he sent more servants to tell them, 'The feast is ready, the food is prepared, come to the wedding.' But they ignored the invitation and went about their business. Some even mistreated and killed the servants. The king was angry and sent his army to destroy those murderers and burn their city. Then he said to his servants, 'The wedding is ready, but those invited were not worthy. Go to the streets and invite anyone you find.' The servants did so and gathered all they could find, both good and bad, and the wedding hall was filled with guests. But when the king came in to see the guests, he noticed a man not wearing wedding clothes. He asked, 'Friend, how did you get in here without wedding clothes?' The man was speechless. Then the king told the attendants, 'Tie him hand and foot, and throw him outside into the darkness, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.' For many are invited, but few are chosen."

Then the Pharisees plotted to trap Jesus with his words. They sent their disciples with the Herodians to him, saying, "Teacher, we know you are truthful and teach God's way truthfully. You don't care about anyone's opinion because you don't look at people's status. Tell us, is it right to pay taxes to Caesar or not?" Jesus, knowing their evil intent, said, "Why are you trying to trap me, you hypocrites? Show me the coin used for the tax." They brought him a denarius, and he asked, "Whose image and inscription is this?" "Caesar's," they replied. Then he said, "Give back to Caesar what is Caesar's, and to God what is God's." They were amazed and left him.

That same day, the Sadducees, who say there is no resurrection, came to him with a question: "Teacher, Moses said if a man dies without children, his brother should marry the widow and have children for him. There were seven brothers among us. The first married and died without children, so his brother married the widow. The same happened to the second and third brother, right down to the seventh. Finally, the woman died. Now then, at the resurrection, whose wife will she be of the seven, since all of them were married to her?" Jesus replied, "You are mistaken because you do not know the Scriptures or the power of God. At the resurrection, people will neither marry nor be given in marriage; they will be like the angels in heaven. But about the resurrection of the deadâ€”have you not read what God said to you, 'I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob'? He is not the God of the dead but of the living." When the crowds heard this, they were astonished at his teaching.

Hearing that Jesus had silenced the Sadducees, the Pharisees got together. One of them, an expert in the law, tested him with this question: "Teacher, which is the greatest commandment in the Law?" Jesus replied, "Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind. This is the first and greatest commandment. And the second is like it: Love your neighbor as yourself. All the Law and the Prophets hang on these two commandments."

While the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus asked them, "What do you think about the Messiah? Whose son is he?" "The son of David," they replied. He said to them, "How is it then that David, speaking by the Spirit, calls him 'Lord'? For he says, 'The Lord said to my Lord: "Sit at my right hand until I put your enemies under your feet."' If then David calls him 'Lord,' how can he be his son?" No one could say a word in reply, and from that day on no one dared to ask him any more questions.
