He went into all the region around the Jordan, preaching a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins, as it is written in the book of the words of Isaiah the prophet: \\\"A voice of one calling in the wilderness, 'Prepare the way for the Lord, make straight paths for him. Every valley shall be filled in, every mountain and hill made low. The crooked roads shall become straight, the rough ways smooth. And all people will see God's salvation.'\\\"\\n\\nJohn said to the crowds coming out to be baptized by him, \\\"You brood of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the coming wrath? Produce fruit in keeping with repentance. And do not begin to say to yourselves, 'We have Abraham as our father.' For I tell you that out of these stones God can raise up children for Abraham.

John answered them all, \\\"I baptize you with water. But one who is more powerful than I will come, the straps of whose sandals I am not worthy to untie. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire. His winnowing fork is in his hand to clear his threshing floor and to gather the wheat into his barn, but he will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire.\\\" And with many other words John exhorted the people and proclaimed the good news to them.\\n\\nBut when John rebuked Herod the tetrarch because of his marriage to Herodias, his brother's wife, and all the other evil things he had done, Herod added this to them all: He locked John up in prison.\\n\\nWhen all the people were being baptized, Jesus was baptized too.

Unrolling it, he found the place where it is written: \\\"The Spirit of the Lord is on me, because he has anointed me to proclaim good news to the poor. He has sent me to proclaim freedom for the prisoners and recovery of sight for the blind, to set the oppressed free, to proclaim the year of the Lord's favor.\\\"\\n\\nThen he rolled up the scroll, gave it back to the attendant, and sat down.

And you will tell me, 'Do here in your hometown what we have heard that you did in Capernaum.'\\\" \\\"Truly I tell you,\\\" he continued, \\\"no prophet is accepted in his hometown. I assure you that there were many widows in Israel in Elijah's time, when the sky was shut for three and a half years and there was a severe famine throughout the land.

And there were many in Israel with leprosy in the time of Elisha the prophet, yet not one of them was cleansed\u2014only Naaman the Syrian.\\\"\\n\\nAll the people in the synagogue were furious when they heard this. They got up, drove him out of the town, and took him to the brow of the hill on which the town was built, in order to throw him off the cliff. But he walked right through the crowd and went on his way.\\n\\nThen he went down to Capernaum, a town in Galilee, and on the Sabbath he taught the people. They were amazed at his teaching, because his words had authority. In the synagogue, there was a man possessed by a demon, an impure spirit. He cried out at the top of his voice, \\\"Go away! What do you want with us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are\u2014the Holy One of God!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Be quiet!\\\" Jesus said sternly. \\\"Come out of him!\\\" Then the demon threw the man down before them all and came out without injuring him.

Then he sat down and taught the people from the boat.\\n\\nWhen he finished speaking, he told Simon, \\\"Go out into the deep water and let down your nets for a catch.\\\" Simon replied, \\\"Master, we've worked hard all night and haven't caught anything.

Then Jesus ordered him, \\\"Don't tell anyone, but go, show yourself to the priest and offer the sacrifices that Moses commanded for your cleansing, as a testimony to them.\\\"\\n\\nYet the news about him spread all the more, so that crowds of people came to hear him and to be healed of their sicknesses. But Jesus often withdrew to lonely places and prayed.\\n\\nOne day Jesus was teaching, and Pharisees and teachers of the law were sitting there. They had come from every village of Galilee and from Judea and Jerusalem. And the power of the Lord was with Jesus to heal the sick. Some men came carrying a paralyzed man on a mat and tried to take him into the house to lay him before Jesus. When they could not find a way to do this because of the crowd, they went up on the roof and lowered him on his mat through the tiles into the middle of the crowd, right in front of Jesus.\\n\\nWhen Jesus saw their faith, he said, \\\"Friend, your sins are forgiven.\\\" The Pharisees and the teachers of the law began thinking to themselves, \\\"Who is this fellow who speaks blasphemy? Who can forgive sins but God alone?\\\" Jesus knew what they were thinking and asked, \\\"Why are you thinking these things in your hearts? Which is easier: to say, 'Your sins are forgiven,' or to say, 'Get up and walk'? But I want you to know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins.\\\" So he said to the paralyzed man, \\\"I tell you, get up, take your mat and go home.\\\" Immediately he stood up in front of them, took what he had been lying on, and went home praising God.\\n\\nEveryone was amazed and gave praise to God. They were filled with awe and said, \\\"We have seen remarkable things today.\\\"\\n\\nAfter this, Jesus went out and saw a tax collector by the name of Levi sitting at his tax booth. \\\"Follow me,\\\" Jesus said to him, and Levi got up, left everything and followed him.\\n\\nThen Levi held a great banquet for Jesus at his house, and a large crowd of tax collectors and others were eating with them.

But the Pharisees and the teachers of the law were furious and began to discuss with one another what they might do to Jesus.\\n\\nOne of those days, Jesus went out to a mountainside to pray, and spent the night praying to God. When morning came, he called his disciples to him and chose twelve of them, whom he also designated apostles: Simon (whom he named Peter), his brother Andrew, James, John, Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew, Thomas, James son of Alphaeus, Simon who was called the Zealot, Judas son of James, and Judas Iscariot, who became a traitor.\\n\\nHe went down with them and stood on a level place. A large crowd of his disciples was there and a great number of people from all over Judea, from Jerusalem, and from the coastal region around Tyre and Sidon, who had come to hear him and to be healed of their diseases. Those troubled by impure spirits were cured, and the people all tried to touch him, because power was coming from him and healing them all.\\n\\nLooking at his disciples, he said: \\\"Blessed are you who are poor, for yours is the kingdom of God. Blessed are you who hunger now, for you will be satisfied. Blessed are you who weep now, for you will laugh. Blessed are you when people hate you, when they exclude you and insult you and reject your name as evil, because of the Son of Man.

Woe to you who laugh now, for you will mourn and weep. Woe to you when everyone speaks well of you, for that is how their ancestors treated the false prophets.\\n\\nBut to you who are listening I say: Love your enemies, do good to those who hate you, bless those who curse you, pray for those who mistreat you. If someone slaps you on one cheek, turn to them the other also. If someone takes your coat, do not withhold your shirt from them. Give to everyone who asks you, and if anyone takes what belongs to you, do not demand it back. Do to others as you would have them do to you.\\n\\nIf you love those who love you, what credit is that to you? Even sinners love those who love them. And if you do good to those who are good to you, what credit is that to you? Even sinners do that. And if you lend to those from whom you expect repayment, what credit is that to you? Even sinners lend to sinners, expecting to be repaid in full. But love your enemies, do good to them, and lend to them without expecting to get anything back. Then your reward will be great, and you will be children of the Most High, because he is kind to the ungrateful and wicked. Be merciful, just as your Father is merciful.\\n\\nDo not judge, and you will not be judged. Do not condemn, and you will not be condemned. Forgive, and you will be forgiven. Give, and it will be given to you. A good measure, pressed down, shaken together and running over, will be poured into your lap. For with the measure you use, it will be measured to you.\\\"\\n\\nHe also told them this parable: \\\"Can the blind lead the blind? Will they not both fall into a pit? The student is not above the teacher, but everyone who is fully trained will be like their teacher.\\n\\nWhy do you look at the speck of sawdust in your brother's eye and pay no attention to the plank in your own eye?

You hypocrite, first take the plank out of your eye, and then you will see clearly to remove the speck from your brother's eye.\\n\\nNo good tree bears bad fruit, nor does a bad tree bear good fruit. Each tree is recognized by its own fruit. People do not pick figs from thornbushes, or grapes from briers.

For the mouth speaks what the heart is full of.\\n\\nWhy do you call me, 'Lord, Lord,' and do not do what I say?

They are like a man building a house, who dug down deep and laid the foundation on rock. When a flood came, the torrent struck that house but could not shake it, because it was well built.

The elders went to Jesus and pleaded with him, saying, \\\"This man deserves your help because he loves our nation and has built our synagogue.\\\"\\n\\nSo Jesus went with them.

He said, \\\"Young man, I say to you, get up!\\\" The dead man sat up and began to talk, and Jesus gave him back to his mother. They were all filled with awe and praised God. \\\"A great prophet has appeared among us,\\\" they said. \\\"God has come to help his people.\\\" This news about Jesus spread throughout Judea and the surrounding country.\\n\\nJohn's disciples told him about all these things. Calling two of them, he sent them to the Lord to ask, \\\"Are you the one who is to come, or should we expect someone else?\\\" When the men came to Jesus, they said, \\\"John the Baptist sent us to you to ask, 'Are you the one who is to come, or should we expect someone else?'\\\"\\n\\nAt that very time, Jesus cured many who had diseases, sicknesses, and evil spirits, and gave sight to many who were blind.

Blessed is anyone who does not stumble on account of me.\\\"\\n\\nAfter John's messengers left, Jesus began to speak to the crowd about John: \\\"What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed swayed by the wind? If not, what did you go out to see? A man dressed in fine clothes? No, those who wear expensive clothes and indulge in luxury are in palaces.

What are they like? They are like children sitting in the marketplace and calling out to each other: 'We played the pipe for you, and you did not dance; we sang a dirge, and you did not cry.'

The Son of Man came eating and drinking, and you say, 'Here is a glutton and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners.'

A woman in that town who lived a sinful life learned that Jesus was eating at the Pharisee's house, so she came there with an alabaster jar of perfume. As she stood behind him at his feet weeping, she began to wet his feet with her tears. Then she wiped them with her hair, kissed them, and poured perfume on them.\\n\\nWhen the Pharisee who had invited him saw this, he said to himself, \\\"If this man were a prophet, he would know who is touching him and what kind of woman she is\u2014that she is a sinner.\\\"\\n\\nJesus answered him, \\\"Simon, I have something to tell you.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Tell me, teacher,\\\" he said.\\n\\n\\\"Two people owed money to a certain moneylender.

The twelve disciples were with him, along with some women who had been healed of evil spirits and illnesses. Among them was Mary Magdalene, from whom seven demons had been cast out, Joanna, the wife of Herod's steward Chuza, Susanna, and many others who supported them with their resources.\\n\\nA large crowd gathered, and people from different towns came to see him. Jesus told them a parable: \\\"A farmer went out to sow his seed. As he was scattering the seed, some fell along the path, where it was trampled on, and the birds ate it up. Some fell on rocky ground, and when it came up, the plants withered because they had no moisture. Other seed fell among thorns, which grew up with it and choked the plants. Still other seed fell on good soil. It came up and yielded a crop, a hundred times more than was sown.\\\"\\n\\nAfter telling the parable, Jesus said, \\\"Whoever has ears to hear, let them hear.\\\" His disciples asked him what the parable meant. He replied, \\\"The knowledge of the secrets of the kingdom of God has been given to you, but to others I speak in parables, so that, 'though seeing, they may not see; though hearing, they may not understand.'\\n\\n\\\"This is the meaning of the parable: The seed is the word of God. Those along the path are the ones who hear, and then the devil comes and takes away the word from their hearts, so that they may not believe and be saved. Those on the rocky ground are the ones who receive the word with joy when they hear it, but they have no root. They believe for a while, but in the time of testing, they fall away. The seed that fell among thorns stands for those who hear, but as they go on their way, they are choked by life's worries, riches, and pleasures, and they do not mature. But the seed on good soil stands for those with a noble and good heart, who hear the word, retain it, and by persevering produce a crop.\\n\\n\\\"No one lights a lamp and hides it in a jar or puts it under a bed. Instead, they put it on a stand, so that those who come in can see the light. For there is nothing hidden that will not be disclosed, and nothing concealed that will not be known or brought out into the open. Therefore consider carefully how you listen. Whoever has will be given more; whoever does not have, even what they think they have will be taken from them.\\\"\\n\\nJesus' mother and brothers came to see him, but they could not get near him because of the crowd. Someone told him, \\\"Your mother and brothers are standing outside, wanting to see you.\\\" He replied, \\\"My mother and brothers are those who hear God's word and put it into practice.\\\"\\n\\nOne day, Jesus got into a boat with his disciples and said, \\\"Let's go over to the other side of the lake.\\\" As they sailed, he fell asleep. A storm came down on the lake, so that the boat was being swamped, and they were in great danger. The disciples went and woke him, saying, \\\"Master, Master, we're going to drown!\\\" He got up and rebuked the wind and the raging waters; the storm subsided, and all was calm. \\\"Where is your faith?\\\" he asked his disciples. In fear and amazement, they asked one another, \\\"Who is this? He commands even the winds and the water, and they obey him.\\\"\\n\\nThey sailed to the region of the Gerasenes, which is across the lake from Galilee. When Jesus stepped ashore, he was met by a demon-possessed man from the town. For a long time, this man had not worn clothes or lived in a house, but had lived in the tombs. When he saw Jesus, he cried out and fell at his feet, shouting at the top of his voice, \\\"What do you want with me, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I beg you, don't torture me!\\\" For Jesus had commanded the impure spirit to come out of the man. Many times it had seized him, and though he was chained hand and foot and kept under guard, he had broken his chains and had been driven by the demon into solitary places.\\n\\nJesus asked him, \\\"What is your name?\\\" \\\"Legion,\\\" he replied, because many demons had gone into him. And they begged Jesus repeatedly not to order them to go into the Abyss.\\n\\nA large herd of pigs was feeding there on the hillside. The demons begged Jesus to let them go into the pigs, and he gave them permission. When the demons came out of the man, they went into the pigs, and the herd rushed down the steep bank into the lake and was drowned.\\n\\nWhen those tending the pigs saw what had happened, they ran off and reported this in the town and countryside, and the people went out to see what had happened. When they came to Jesus, they found the man from whom the demons had gone out, sitting at Jesus' feet, dressed and in his right mind; and they were afraid. Those who had seen it told the people how the demon-possessed man had been cured.\\n\\nThen all the people of the region of the Gerasenes asked Jesus to leave them, because they were overcome with fear. So he got into the boat and left. The man from whom the demons had gone out begged to go with him, but Jesus sent him away, saying, \\\"Return home and tell how much God has done for you.\\\" So the man went away and told all over town how much Jesus had done for him.\\n\\nWhen Jesus returned, a crowd welcomed him, for they were all expecting him. Then a man named Jairus, a synagogue leader, came and fell at Jesus' feet, pleading with him to come to his house because his only daughter, a girl of about twelve, was dying. As Jesus was on his way, the crowds almost crushed him.\\n\\nAnd a woman was there who had been subject to bleeding for twelve years, but no one could heal her. She came up behind him and touched the edge of his cloak, and immediately her bleeding stopped. \\\"Who touched me?\\\" Jesus asked. When they all denied it, Peter said, \\\"Master, the people are crowding and pressing against you.\\\" But Jesus said, \\\"Someone touched me; I know that power has gone out from me.\\\"\\n\\nThen the woman, seeing that she could not go unnoticed, came trembling and fell at his feet. In the presence of all the people, she told why she had touched him and how she had been instantly healed. Then he said to her, \\\"Daughter, your faith has healed you. Go in peace.\\\"\\n\\nWhile Jesus was still speaking, someone came from the house of Jairus, the synagogue leader. \\\"Your daughter is dead,\\\" he said. \\\"Don't bother the teacher anymore.\\\" Hearing this, Jesus said to Jairus, \\\"Don't be afraid; just believe, and she will be healed.\\\"\\n\\nWhen he arrived at the house of Jairus, he did not let anyone go in with him except Peter, John, and James, and the child's father and mother. Meanwhile, all the people were wailing and mourning for her. \\\"Stop wailing,\\\" Jesus said. \\\"She is not dead but asleep.\\\" They laughed at him, knowing that she was dead. But he took her by the hand and said, \\\"My child, get up!\\\" Her spirit returned, and at once she stood up. Then Jesus told them to give her something to eat. Her parents were astonished, but he ordered them not to tell anyone what had happened.\"}", "refusal": null, "annotations": []}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4994, "completion_tokens": 1651, "total_tokens": 6645, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}}, "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_6dd05565ef"}}, "error": null}

Whatever house you enter, stay there until you leave that town. If people do not welcome you, leave their town and shake the dust off your feet as a testimony against them.\\\" So they set out and went from village to village, proclaiming the good news and healing people everywhere.\\n\\nHerod the tetrarch heard about all that was happening, and he was perplexed because some were saying that John had been raised from the dead, others that Elijah had appeared, and still others that one of the prophets of long ago had come back to life. But Herod said, \\\"I beheaded John. Who, then, is this I hear such things about?\\\" And he tried to see him.\\n\\nWhen the apostles returned, they reported to Jesus what they had done. Then he took them with him and they withdrew by themselves to a town called Bethsaida, but the crowds learned about it and followed him. He welcomed them and spoke to them about the kingdom of God, and healed those who needed healing.\\n\\nLate in the afternoon, the Twelve came to him and said, \\\"Send the crowd away so they can go to the surrounding villages and countryside and find food and lodging, because we are in a remote place here.\\\" He replied, \\\"You give them something to eat.\\\" They answered, \\\"We have only five loaves of bread and two fish\u2014unless we go and buy food for all this crowd.\\\" (About five thousand men were there.) But he said to his disciples, \\\"Have them sit down in groups of about fifty each.\\\" The disciples did so, and everyone sat down. Taking the five loaves and the two fish and looking up to heaven, he gave thanks and broke them. Then he gave them to the disciples to distribute to the people. They all ate and were satisfied, and the disciples picked up twelve basketfuls of broken pieces that were left over.\\n\\nOnce when Jesus was praying in private and his disciples were with him, he asked them, \\\"Who do the crowds say I am?\\\" They replied, \\\"Some say John the Baptist; others say Elijah; and still others, that one of the prophets of long ago has come back to life.\\\" \\\"But what about you?\\\" he asked. \\\"Who do you say I am?\\\" Peter answered, \\\"God\u2019s Messiah.\\\"\\n\\nJesus strictly warned them not to tell this to anyone. And he said, \\\"The Son of Man must suffer many things and be rejected by the elders, the chief priests and the teachers of the law, and he must be killed and on the third day be raised to life.\\\" Then he said to them all: \\\"Whoever wants to be my disciple must deny themselves and take up their cross daily and follow me. For whoever wants to save their life will lose it, but whoever loses their life for me will save it. What good is it for someone to gain the whole world, and yet lose or forfeit their very self? Whoever is ashamed of me and my words, the Son of Man will be ashamed of them when he comes in his glory and in the glory of the Father and of the holy angels. Truly I tell you, some who are standing here will not taste death before they see the kingdom of God.\\\"\\n\\nAbout eight days after Jesus said this, he took Peter, John and James with him and went up onto a mountain to pray. As he was praying, the appearance of his face changed, and his clothes became as bright as a flash of lightning. Two men, Moses and Elijah, appeared in glorious splendor, talking with Jesus. They spoke about his departure, which he was about to bring to fulfillment at Jerusalem. Peter and his companions were very sleepy, but when they became fully awake, they saw his glory and the two men standing with him. As the men were leaving Jesus, Peter said to him, \\\"Master, it is good for us to be here. Let us put up three shelters\u2014one for you, one for Moses and one for Elijah.\\\" (He did not know what he was saying.) While he was speaking, a cloud appeared and covered them, and they were afraid as they entered the cloud. A voice came from the cloud, saying, \\\"This is my Son, whom I have chosen; listen to him.\\\" When the voice had spoken, they found that Jesus was alone. The disciples kept this to themselves and did not tell anyone at that time what they had seen.\\n\\nThe next day, when they came down from the mountain, a large crowd met him. A man in the crowd called out, \\\"Teacher, I beg you to look at my son, for he is my only child. A spirit seizes him and he suddenly screams; it throws him into convulsions so that he foams at the mouth. It scarcely ever leaves him and is destroying him. I begged your disciples to drive it out, but they could not.\\\" \\\"You unbelieving and perverse generation,\\\" Jesus replied, \\\"how long shall I stay with you and put up with you? Bring your son here.\\\" Even while the boy was coming, the demon threw him to the ground in a convulsion. But Jesus rebuked the impure spirit, healed the boy and gave him back to his father. And they were all amazed at the greatness of God.\\n\\nWhile everyone was marveling at all that Jesus did, he said to his disciples, \\\"Listen carefully to what I am about to tell you: The Son of Man is going to be delivered into the hands of men.\\\" But they did not understand what this meant. It was hidden from them, so that they did not grasp it, and they were afraid to ask him about it.\\n\\nAn argument started among the disciples as to which of them would be the greatest. Jesus, knowing their thoughts, took a little child and had him stand beside him. Then he said to them, \\\"Whoever welcomes this little child in my name welcomes me; and whoever welcomes me welcomes the one who sent me. For it is the one who is least among you all who is the greatest.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Master,\\\" said John, \\\"we saw someone driving out demons in your name and we tried to stop him, because he is not one of us.\\\" \\\"Do not stop him,\\\" Jesus said, \\\"for whoever is not against you is for you.\\\"\\n\\nAs the time approached for him to be taken up to heaven, Jesus resolutely set out for Jerusalem. And he sent messengers on ahead, who went into a Samaritan village to get things ready for him; but the people there did not welcome him, because he was heading for Jerusalem. When the disciples James and John saw this, they asked, \\\"Lord, do you want us to call fire down from heaven to destroy them?\\\" But Jesus turned and rebuked them. Then he and his disciples went to another village.\\n\\nAs they were walking along the road, a man said to him, \\\"I will follow you wherever you go.\\\" Jesus replied, \\\"Foxes have dens and birds have nests, but the Son of Man has no place to lay his head.\\\" He said to another man, \\\"Follow me.\\\" But he replied, \\\"Lord, first let me go and bury my father.\\\" Jesus said to him, \\\"Let the dead bury their own dead, but you go and proclaim the kingdom of God.\\\" Still another said, \\\"I will follow you, Lord; but first let me go back and say goodbye to my family.\\\" Jesus replied, \\\"No one who puts a hand to the plow and looks back is fit for service in the kingdom of God.\\\"\"}", "refusal": null, "annotations": []}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 5361, "completion_tokens": 1637, "total_tokens": 6998, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}}, "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_6dd05565ef"}}, "error": null}

Do not take a purse or bag or sandals, and do not greet anyone on the road. When you enter a house, first say, 'Peace to this house.'

So too, a Levite, when he came to the place and saw him, passed by on the other side. But a Samaritan, as he traveled, came where the man was; and when he saw him, he took pity on him. He went to him and bandaged his wounds, pouring on oil and wine. Then he put the man on his own donkey, brought him to an inn and took care of him.

He said there was a judge in a city who didn't fear God or care about people. A widow in that city kept coming to him, asking for justice against her enemy. For a while, he refused, but later he thought, \\\"Even though I don't fear God or care about people, I'll give her justice so she won't keep bothering me.\\\" Jesus said, \\\"Listen to what the unjust judge says. Won't God bring justice for His chosen ones who cry out to Him day and night? He will see that they get justice quickly. But when the Son of Man comes, will He find faith on the earth?\\\"\\n\\nJesus also told this story to some who were confident in their own righteousness and looked down on others. Two men went to the temple to pray, one a Pharisee and the other a tax collector. The Pharisee stood by himself and prayed, \\\"God, I thank you that I am not like other people\u2014robbers, evildoers, adulterers\u2014or even like this tax collector. I fast twice a week and give a tenth of all I get.\\\" But the tax collector stood at a distance. He wouldn't even look up to heaven, but beat his chest and said, \\\"God, have mercy on me, a sinner.\\\" Jesus said, \\\"I tell you that this man, rather than the other, went home justified before God. For all those who exalt themselves will be humbled, and those who humble themselves will be exalted.\\\"\\n\\nPeople were also bringing babies to Jesus for Him to place His hands on them. When the disciples saw this, they rebuked them.

You know the commandments: 'You shall not commit adultery, you shall not murder, you shall not steal, you shall not give false testimony, honor your father and mother.'\\\" \\\"All these I have kept since I was a boy,\\\" he said. When Jesus heard this, He said to him, \\\"You still lack one thing. Sell everything you have and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come, follow me.\\\" When he heard this, he became very sad, because he was very wealthy. Jesus looked at him and said, \\\"How hard it is for the rich to enter the kingdom of God! Indeed, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of God.\\\" Those who heard this asked, \\\"Who then can be saved?\\\" Jesus replied, \\\"What is impossible with man is possible with God.\\\"\\n\\nPeter said to Him, \\\"We have left all we had to follow you!\\\" \\\"Truly I tell you,\\\" Jesus said to them, \\\"no one who has left home or wife or brothers or sisters or parents or children for the sake of the kingdom of God will fail to receive many times as much in this age, and in the age to come eternal life.\\\"\\n\\nJesus took the Twelve aside and told them, \\\"We are going up to Jerusalem, and everything that is written by the prophets about the Son of Man will be fulfilled.

He wanted to see who Jesus was, but he couldn't because of the crowd, as he was short. So he ran ahead and climbed a sycamore tree to see Jesus, who was going to pass that way. When Jesus reached the spot, he looked up and said, \\\"Zacchaeus, come down quickly, for I must stay at your house today.\\\" Zacchaeus came down at once and welcomed him gladly. All the people saw this and began to mutter, \\\"He has gone to be the guest of a sinner.\\\" But Zacchaeus stood up and said to the Lord, \\\"Look, Lord! Here and now I give half of my possessions to the poor, and if I have cheated anybody out of anything, I will pay back four times the amount.\\\" Jesus said to him, \\\"Today salvation has come to this house, because this man, too, is a son of Abraham. For the Son of Man came to seek and to save the lost.\\\"\\n\\nWhile they were listening to this, Jesus went on to tell them a parable, because he was near Jerusalem and the people thought that the kingdom of God was going to appear at once. He said, \\\"A man of noble birth went to a distant country to have himself appointed king and then to return. So he called ten of his servants and gave them ten minas. 'Put this money to work,' he said, 'until I come back.' But his subjects hated him and sent a delegation after him to say, 'We don't want this man to be our king.'\\n\\n\\\"He was made king, however, and returned home. Then he sent for the servants to whom he had given the money, in order to find out what they had gained with it. The first one came and said, 'Sir, your mina has earned ten more.'\\n\\n\\\"'Well done, my good servant!' his master replied. 'Because you have been trustworthy in a very small matter, take charge of ten cities.'\\n\\n\\\"The second came and said, 'Sir, your mina has earned five more.'\\n\\n\\\"His master answered, 'You take charge of five cities.'\\n\\n\\\"Then another servant came and said, 'Sir, here is your mina; I have kept it laid away in a piece of cloth. I was afraid of you, because you are a hard man. You take out what you did not put in and reap what you did not sow.'\\n\\n\\\"His master replied, 'I will judge you by your own words, you wicked servant! You knew, did you, that I am a hard man, taking out what I did not put in and reaping what I did not sow? Why then didn't you put my money on deposit, so that when I came back, I could have collected it with interest?'\\n\\n\\\"Then he said to those standing by, 'Take his mina away from him and give it to the one who has ten minas.'\\n\\n\\\"'Sir,' they said, 'he already has ten!'\\n\\n\\\"He replied, 'I tell you that to everyone who has, more will be given, but as for the one who has nothing, even what they have will be taken away. But those enemies of mine who did not want me to be king over them\u2014bring them here and kill them in front of me.'\\\"\\n\\nAfter Jesus had said this, he went on ahead, going up to Jerusalem. As he approached Bethphage and Bethany at the hill called the Mount of Olives, he sent two of his disciples, saying to them, \\\"Go to the village ahead of you, and as you enter it, you will find a colt tied there, which no one has ever ridden. Untie it and bring it here. If anyone asks you, 'Why are you untying it?' say, 'The Lord needs it.'\\\"\\n\\nThose who were sent ahead went and found it just as he had told them. As they were untying the colt, its owners asked them, \\\"Why are you untying the colt?\\\"\\n\\nThey replied, \\\"The Lord needs it.\\\"\\n\\nThey brought it to Jesus, threw their cloaks on the colt, and put Jesus on it. As he went along, people spread their cloaks on the road. When he came near the place where the road goes down the Mount of Olives, the whole crowd of disciples began joyfully to praise God in loud voices for all the miracles they had seen:\\n\\n\\\"Blessed is the king who comes in the name of the Lord! Peace in heaven and glory in the highest!\\\"\\n\\nSome of the Pharisees in the crowd said to Jesus, \\\"Teacher, rebuke your disciples!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I tell you,\\\" he replied, \\\"if they keep quiet, the stones will cry out.\\\"\\n\\nAs he approached Jerusalem and saw the city, he wept over it and said, \\\"If you, even you, had only known on this day what would bring you peace\u2014but now it is hidden from your eyes.

Jesus said to them, \\\"Neither will I tell you by what authority I do these things.\\\"\\n\\nThen he began to tell the people this parable: \\\"A man planted a vineyard, rented it to some farmers, and went away for a long time. At harvest time, he sent a servant to the tenants so they would give him some of the fruit of the vineyard. But the tenants beat him and sent him away empty-handed. He sent another servant, but they also beat and humiliated him and sent him away empty-handed. He sent a third, and they wounded him and threw him out. Then the owner of the vineyard said, 'What shall I do? I will send my beloved son; perhaps they will respect him.' But when the tenants saw him, they discussed among themselves, 'This is the heir. Let's kill him so the inheritance will be ours.' So they threw him out of the vineyard and killed him. What then will the owner of the vineyard do to them? He will come and destroy those tenants and give the vineyard to others.\\\" When the people heard this, they said, \\\"May this never happen!\\\"\\n\\nJesus looked directly at them and asked, \\\"Then what is the meaning of that which is written: 'The stone the builders rejected has become the cornerstone'? Everyone who falls on that stone will be broken to pieces, but anyone on whom it falls will be crushed.\\\" The teachers of the law and the chief priests looked for a way to arrest him immediately, because they knew he had spoken this parable against them. But they were afraid of the people.\\n\\nThey sent spies, who pretended to be sincere, to catch him in something he said, so they might hand him over to the power and authority of the governor. So they questioned him, \\\"Teacher, we know that you speak and teach what is right, and that you do not show partiality but teach the way of God in accordance with the truth. Is it right for us to pay taxes to Caesar or not?\\\" Jesus saw through their trickery and said to them, \\\"Show me a denarius. Whose image and inscription are on it?\\\" \\\"Caesar's,\\\" they replied. He said to them, \\\"Then give back to Caesar what is Caesar's, and to God what is God's.\\\"\\n\\nThey were unable to trap him in what he had said there in public. And astonished by his answer, they became silent.\\n\\nSome of the Sadducees, who say there is no resurrection, came to Jesus with a question. \\\"Teacher,\\\" they said, \\\"Moses wrote for us that if a man's brother dies and leaves a wife but no children, the man must marry the widow and raise up offspring for his brother. Now there were seven brothers. The first one married a woman and died childless. The second and then the third married her, and in the same way, the seven died, leaving no children. Finally, the woman died too. Now then, at the resurrection, whose wife will she be, since the seven were married to her?\\\"\\n\\nJesus replied, \\\"The people of this age marry and are given in marriage. But those who are considered worthy of taking part in the age to come and in the resurrection from the dead will neither marry nor be given in marriage, and they can no longer die; for they are like the angels. They are God's children, since they are children of the resurrection. But in the account of the burning bush, even Moses showed that the dead rise, for he calls the Lord 'the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.' He is not the God of the dead, but of the living, for to him all are alive.\\\"\\n\\nSome of the teachers of the law responded, \\\"Well said, teacher!\\\" And no one dared to ask him any more questions.\\n\\nThen Jesus said to them, \\\"Why is it said that the Messiah is the son of David? David himself declares in the Book of Psalms: 'The Lord said to my Lord: \\\"Sit at my right hand until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet.\\\"' David calls him 'Lord.' How then can he be his son?\\\"\\n\\nWhile all the people were listening, Jesus said to his disciples, \\\"Beware of the teachers of the law. They like to walk around in flowing robes and love to be greeted with respect in the marketplaces and have the most important seats in the synagogues and the places of honor at banquets. They devour widows' houses and for a show make lengthy prayers.

But from now on, the Son of Man will be seated at the right hand of the mighty God.\\\" They all asked, \\\"Are you then the Son of God?\\\" He replied, \\\"You say that I am.\\\" Then they said, \\\"Why do we need any more testimony?

They started accusing him, saying, \\\"We found this man misleading our nation, stopping people from paying taxes to Caesar, and claiming to be Christ, a king.\\\" Pilate asked him, \\\"Are you the king of the Jews?\\\" Jesus replied, \\\"You say so.\\\" Pilate then told the chief priests and the crowd, \\\"I find no fault in this man.\\\" But they insisted, saying, \\\"He stirs up the people, teaching all over Judea, starting from Galilee to here.\\\" When Pilate heard this, he asked if the man was a Galilean. Finding out he was under Herod's jurisdiction, he sent him to Herod, who was also in Jerusalem at that time. Herod was very happy to see Jesus because he had wanted to see him for a long time, having heard about him and hoping to see him perform a miracle. Herod questioned him at length, but Jesus gave no answer. The chief priests and scribes stood by, accusing him strongly. Herod, along with his soldiers, mocked Jesus, dressed him in a splendid robe, and sent him back to Pilate. That day, Herod and Pilate became friends, though they had been enemies before.\\n\\nPilate called together the chief priests, the rulers, and the people, and said, \\\"You brought this man to me as one who incites the people to rebellion. I have examined him in your presence and found no basis for your charges against him. Neither has Herod, for he sent him back to us. As you can see, he has done nothing deserving death. Therefore, I will punish him and release him.\\\" But the whole crowd shouted, \\\"Away with this man! Release Barabbas to us!\\\" Barabbas had been thrown into prison for an uprising in the city and for murder. Wanting to release Jesus, Pilate appealed to them again, but they kept shouting, \\\"Crucify him! Crucify him!\\\" For the third time, he spoke to them, \\\"Why? What crime has this man committed? I have found in him no grounds for the death penalty. Therefore, I will punish him and release him.\\\" But they kept shouting loudly, demanding that he be crucified, and their voices prevailed. So Pilate decided to grant their demand. He released the man who had been thrown into prison for insurrection and murder, the one they asked for, and surrendered Jesus to their will.\\n\\nAs they led him away, they seized Simon from Cyrene, who was on his way in from the country, and put the cross on him to carry behind Jesus. A large number of people followed him, including women who mourned and wailed for him. Jesus turned and said to them, \\\"Daughters of Jerusalem, do not weep for me; weep for yourselves and for your children. For the time will come when you will say, 'Blessed are the childless women, the wombs that never bore and the breasts that never nursed!' Then they will say to the mountains, 'Fall on us!' and to the hills, 'Cover us!' For if people do these things when the tree is green, what will happen when it is dry?\\\"\\n\\nTwo other men, both criminals, were also led out with him to be executed. When they came to the place called the Skull, they crucified him there, along with the criminals\u2014one on his right, the other on his left. They divided up his clothes by casting lots. The people stood watching, and the rulers even sneered at him. They said, \\\"He saved others; let him save himself if he is God\u2019s Messiah, the Chosen One.\\\" The soldiers also came up and mocked him. They offered him wine vinegar and said, \\\"If you are the king of the Jews, save yourself.\\\" There was a written notice above him, which read: THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS.\\n\\nOne of the criminals who hung there hurled insults at him: \\\"Aren\u2019t you the Messiah? Save yourself and us!\\\" But the other criminal rebuked him. \\\"Don\u2019t you fear God,\\\" he said, \\\"since you are under the same sentence? We are punished justly, for we are getting what our deeds deserve. But this man has done nothing wrong.\\\" Then he said, \\\"Jesus, remember me when you come into your kingdom.\\\" Jesus answered him, \\\"Truly I tell you, today you will be with me in paradise.\\\"\\n\\nIt was now about noon, and darkness came over the whole land until three in the afternoon, for the sun stopped shining. And the curtain of the temple was torn in two. Jesus called out with a loud voice, \\\"Father, into your hands I commit my spirit.\\\" When he had said this, he breathed his last.\\n\\nThe centurion, seeing what had happened, praised God and said, \\\"Surely this was a righteous man.\\\" When all the people who had gathered to witness this sight saw what took place, they beat their breasts and went away. But all those who knew him, including the women who had followed him from Galilee, stood at a distance, watching these things.\\n\\nNow there was a man named Joseph, a member of the Council, a good and upright man, who had not consented to their decision and action. He came from the Judean town of Arimathea and he was waiting for the kingdom of God. Going to Pilate, he asked for Jesus\u2019 body. Then he took it down, wrapped it in linen cloth, and placed it in a tomb cut in the rock, one in which no one had yet been laid. It was Preparation Day, and the Sabbath was about to begin. The women who had come with Jesus from Galilee followed Joseph and saw the tomb and how his body was laid in it. Then they went home and prepared spices and perfumes.

They found the stone rolled away from the tomb, but when they entered, they did not find the body of the Lord Jesus. While they were wondering about this, suddenly two men in clothes that gleamed like lightning stood beside them. In their fright, the women bowed down with their faces to the ground, but the men said to them, \\\"Why do you look for the living among the dead? He is not here; he has risen! Remember how he told you, while he was still with you in Galilee: 'The Son of Man must be delivered over to the hands of sinners, be crucified and on the third day be raised again.'\\\" Then they remembered his words.\\n\\nWhen they came back from the tomb, they told all these things to the Eleven and to all the others. It was Mary Magdalene, Joanna, Mary the mother of James, and the others with them who told this to the apostles. But they did not believe the women, because their words seemed to them like nonsense. Peter, however, got up and ran to the tomb. Bending over, he saw the strips of linen lying by themselves, and he went away, wondering to himself what had happened.\\n\\nNow that same day two of them were going to a village called Emmaus, about seven miles from Jerusalem. They were talking with each other about everything that had happened. As they talked and discussed these things with each other, Jesus himself came up and walked along with them; but they were kept from recognizing him.\\n\\nHe asked them, \\\"What are you discussing together as you walk along?\\\" They stood still, their faces downcast. One of them, named Cleopas, asked him, \\\"Are you the only one visiting Jerusalem who does not know the things that have happened there in these days?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"What things?\\\" he asked.\\n\\n\\\"About Jesus of Nazareth,\\\" they replied. \\\"He was a prophet, powerful in word and deed before God and all the people. The chief priests and our rulers handed him over to be sentenced to death, and they crucified him; but we had hoped that he was the one who was going to redeem Israel. And what is more, it is the third day since all this took place. In addition, some of our women amazed us. They went to the tomb early this morning but didn't find his body. They came and told us that they had seen a vision of angels, who said he was alive. Then some of our companions went to the tomb and found it just as the women had said, but they did not see Jesus.\\\"\\n\\nHe said to them, \\\"How foolish you are, and how slow to believe all that the prophets have spoken! Did not the Messiah have to suffer these things and then enter his glory?\\\" And beginning with Moses and all the Prophets, he explained to them what was said in all the Scriptures concerning himself.\\n\\nAs they approached the village to which they were going, Jesus continued on as if he were going farther. But they urged him strongly, \\\"Stay with us, for it is nearly evening; the day is almost over.\\\" So he went in to stay with them.\\n\\nWhen he was at the table with them, he took bread, gave thanks, broke it and began to give it to them. Then their eyes were opened and they recognized him, and he disappeared from their sight. They asked each other, \\\"Were not our hearts burning within us while he talked with us on the road and opened the Scriptures to us?\\\"\\n\\nThey got up and returned at once to Jerusalem. There they found the Eleven and those with them, assembled together and saying, \\\"It is true! The Lord has risen and has appeared to Simon.\\\" Then the two told what had happened on the way, and how Jesus was recognized by them when he broke the bread.\\n\\nWhile they were still talking about this, Jesus himself stood among them and said to them, \\\"Peace be with you.\\\" They were startled and frightened, thinking they saw a ghost. He said to them, \\\"Why are you troubled, and why do doubts rise in your minds? Look at my hands and my feet. It is I myself! Touch me and see; a ghost does not have flesh and bones, as you see I have.\\\" When he had said this, he showed them his hands and feet. And while they still did not believe it because of joy and amazement, he asked them, \\\"Do you have anything here to eat?\\\" They gave him a piece of broiled fish, and he took it and ate it in their presence.\\n\\nHe said to them, \\\"This is what I told you while I was still with you: Everything must be fulfilled that is written about me in the Law of Moses, the Prophets and the Psalms.\\\" Then he opened their minds so they could understand the Scriptures. He told them, \\\"This is what is written: The Messiah will suffer and rise from the dead on the third day, and repentance for the forgiveness of sins will be preached in his name to all nations, beginning at Jerusalem. You are witnesses of these things. I am going to send you what my Father has promised; but stay in the city until you have been clothed with power from on high.\\\"\\n\\nWhen he had led them out to the vicinity of Bethany, he lifted up his hands and blessed them. While he was blessing them, he left them and was taken up into heaven. Then they worshiped him and returned to Jerusalem with great joy.

A voice of one calling in the wilderness, 'Prepare the way for the Lord, make straight paths for him.'\\\" John the Baptist appeared in the wilderness, preaching a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins. People from all over Judea and Jerusalem went out to him, confessing their sins, and were baptized by him in the Jordan River. John wore clothes made of camel's hair, with a leather belt around his waist, and he ate locusts and wild honey. He preached, saying, \\\"After me comes someone more powerful than I, whose sandals I am not worthy to untie. I baptize you with water, but he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit.\\\"\\n\\nAt that time, Jesus came from Nazareth in Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan. As Jesus was coming up out of the water, he saw heaven being torn open and the Spirit descending on him like a dove. A voice came from heaven: \\\"You are my Son, whom I love; with you I am well pleased.\\\" Immediately, the Spirit sent him out into the wilderness, and he was in the wilderness for forty days, being tempted by Satan. He was with the wild animals, and angels attended him.\\n\\nAfter John was put in prison, Jesus went into Galilee, proclaiming the good news of God. \\\"The time has come,\\\" he said. \\\"The kingdom of God has come near. Repent and believe the good news!\\\"\\n\\nAs Jesus walked beside the Sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and his brother Andrew casting a net into the lake, for they were fishermen. \\\"Come, follow me,\\\" Jesus said, \\\"and I will send you out to fish for people.\\\" At once they left their nets and followed him. When he had gone a little farther, he saw James son of Zebedee and his brother John in a boat, preparing their nets. Without delay, he called them, and they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired men and followed him.\\n\\nThey went to Capernaum, and when the Sabbath came, Jesus went into the synagogue and began to teach. The people were amazed at his teaching, because he taught them as one who had authority, not as the teachers of the law. Just then a man in their synagogue who was possessed by an impure spirit cried out, \\\"What do you want with us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are\u2014the Holy One of God!\\\" \\\"Be quiet!\\\" said Jesus sternly. \\\"Come out of him!\\\" The impure spirit shook the man violently and came out of him with a shriek.\\n\\nThe people were all so amazed that they asked each other, \\\"What is this? A new teaching\u2014and with authority! He even gives orders to impure spirits and they obey him.\\\" News about him spread quickly over the whole region of Galilee.\\n\\nAs soon as they left the synagogue, they went with James and John to the home of Simon and Andrew. Simon's mother-in-law was in bed with a fever, and they immediately told Jesus about her. So he went to her, took her hand and helped her up. The fever left her and she began to wait on them.\\n\\nThat evening after sunset, the people brought to Jesus all the sick and demon-possessed. The whole town gathered at the door, and Jesus healed many who had various diseases. He also drove out many demons, but he would not let the demons speak because they knew who he was.\\n\\nVery early in the morning, while it was still dark, Jesus got up, left the house and went off to a solitary place, where he prayed. Simon and his companions went to look for him, and when they found him, they exclaimed: \\\"Everyone is looking for you!\\\" Jesus replied, \\\"Let us go somewhere else\u2014to the nearby villages\u2014so I can preach there also. That is why I have come.\\\" So he traveled throughout Galilee, preaching in their synagogues and driving out demons.\\n\\nA man with leprosy came to him and begged him on his knees, \\\"If you are willing, you can make me clean.\\\" Jesus was indignant. He reached out his hand and touched the man. \\\"I am willing,\\\" he said. \\\"Be clean!\\\" Immediately the leprosy left him and he was cleansed. Jesus sent him away at once with a strong warning: \\\"See that you don't tell this to anyone. But go, show yourself to the priest and offer the sacrifices that Moses commanded for your cleansing, as a testimony to them.\\\" Instead he went out and began to talk freely, spreading the news. As a result, Jesus could no longer enter a town openly but stayed outside in lonely places.
